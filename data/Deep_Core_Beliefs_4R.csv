part of the borrowing countries, on the part of the lending 
institutions in countries, whatever you think, sadly today, 
overwhelmingly the victims are innocent people, residents of 
these countries, and our job is to alleviate their misery.

NHTF Hearing.txt," am also here today to share new evidence that shows that 
housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may

frequently move. We know children who stay in the same home 
and do not more frequently have better child development outcomes 
and do better in school. ",12
NHTF Hearing.txt," And if anyone believes that the Federal Government or 
State governments or local governments can really make the difference 
in housing, they don’t understand the importance of the 
role of the nonprofit agencies and the difference they have made in 
terms of low-income housing and needed housing throughout our 
country. ",12
NHTF Hearing.txt," And since we have 
enacted pro-growth tax policies in 2003, we have had 8.2 million 
new jobs created. And yet many in this House and many on the 
committee want the tax relief to go away. And, as you take away 
the tax relief, you begin to take away the jobs. 

Secondly, if we truly care about affordable housing, we need to 
realize how the single largest tax increase in American history contained 
within the Democrat budget resolution, how that impacts 
families who are trying to make their homes affordable. 

I hear from constituents in my district. I hear from the Brucker 
Family in Wills Point who writes, ‘‘No increase in taxes. My family 
is only one breath away from losing our home as it is.’’ 

I hear from the Stevens Family in Forney, Texas, ‘‘If our taxes 
increased $2,755, we would not be able to pay our mortgage.’’ And 
the list goes on and on and on. We need to realize that more spending 
fuels more taxes which makes homes less affordable. 

Third, it seems ironic to me that we would increase taxes on 
some, make housing less affordable for many low- and middle-income 
Americans because we know that Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac are an effectively a government protected duopoly. They have 
great economic power to simply pass along these fees or taxes, if 
you will, ultimately to the consumer. And so this is a mortgage tax, 
pure and simple. ",13
CHRG-110hhrg44182.htm," Another concern is that we don't really do enough in this

awful lot, for any of us to feel good about it.",12
NHTF Hearing.txt," As I have expressed since its inception, this fund 
is straight out of Central Planning 101. This is really a step in the 
wrong direction. 

There appears here to be a clear conflict of vision. I think past 
government housing programs have actually done very little, if you 
look at the record, to increase homeownership levels in this country. 
We do not have much to show for the tens of billions of dollars 
we spent on housing through HUD and FHA, but there is a way 
to improve homeownership rates. 

They improve when real interest rates are low and when consumer 
incomes are high. Under that kind of an environment people 
can afford to frankly get into a position where they can buy their 
own home. I believe limited government and free market policies 
will generate these results; creeping socialism will not. It will work 
more as an anchor on the economy and prosperity. It will keep the 
private sector from becoming as vibrant and creating the opportunities 
for people so that they can move up. 

This fund will waste resources. It’s going to provide false hope 
for those who wish to increase homeownership. Additionally this 
fund will create a terrible precedent, a terrible, terrible precedent 
for other industries in this country. As I said during the GSE and

CHRG-107hhrg77785.htm," how do you promote policies in the world that increase 
prosperity without so exacerbating inequality that social 
tensions reach the point where it interferes with progress?
    We've got a worldwide consensus that capitalism is without 
question the best way to generate wealth. There was a few years 
ago a consensus that said in addition to a capitalist system, 
you needed to make that work by a very minimalist public sector 
approach. And that I think has been called into question by 
events. When Franklin Roosevelt became President, he made the 
decision to try to preserve the capitalist system. There were 
some hems and haws in how he ultimately decided to do that. But 
the notion was that we would have the capitalist system plus a 
Government role involving some regulation and some intervention 
to provide social equity.
    Our challenge today is to try and duplicate that kind of 
approach on the global scale. Now it's extremely harder. You're 
not dealing with one sovereignty. But it's the same kind of 
intellectual problem. How do you give full rein to the 
capitalist system, which after all depends on inequality to 
work, if you do not have people unequally rewarded according to 
how hard they work, how smart they invest, how cunningly they 
anticipate public needs, and so forth? Then you don't get the 
wealth creation. What I believe and many others, and I think 
this was what Franklin Roosevelt argued, there is a point 
beyond which the inequality can become dysfunctional. That it 
can be more than is necessary to give the proper incentives.

And I am of the opinion that full employment ought to be one of the goals of this government.
  Every time unemployment dips below 5 percent, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve uses employment growth to say that the economy is overheating and as a rationale to raise interest rates, slow the economy, and slow unemployment. Welfare reform promised to move many of the recipients who are on public-assisted housing to work, but if the Fed maintains its present policy, not only will the unemployed increase and the underemployed remain, but the rejected workers will have no government assistance.

HR1892 hearing.txt," I work with 
my friend from Texas on a lot of issues, and there are a lot of areas 
where this committee can cooperate across party lines, but nowhere 
have the differences that do exist between the parties been made 
more clear than in his last statement when he described the effort 
by the gentlewoman from California and myself to provide more 
funding for affordable housing as ‘‘extortion.’’ The FHA is a Federal 
agency created by Federal law. And the notion that it is ‘‘extortion’’ 
to try to use some of the surplus funds it has been generating to 
help provide affordable housing greatly defines the difference between 
the parties. 

I noticed that the gentlewoman from Illinois—who temporarily 
had to leave and who has been a very constructive member also— 
said, ‘‘Well, we should not be using FHA funds for other purposes.’’ 
Maybe she missed this, but during the entire period of Republican 
majority rule, that is exactly what was happening. The FHA was 
producing surpluses which went into the general treasury, and 
they have been used to support such non-housing related issues as 
the war in Iraq, nuclear testing, or anything else the Federal Government 
does. This notion that money should not come from the 
FHA for other purposes is a very new one because the FHA has 
been a money maker for the rest of the Federal Government in the 
past. Now it is true that many of us—including the gentlewoman 
from California and I—believe that if the FHA continues to generate 
surpluses, and we certainly will guarantee that first claim on 
any monies goes to keep the FHA functioning, but the question is 
should the surpluses go into the general treasury and help offset 
everything else the Federal Government does, such as farm subsidies, 
the war in Iraq, bridges to nowhere, and all of those other 
purposes for which it was put, or should we target it towards affordable 
housing? ",12

The Federal Government runs, I believe, over 80 different housing 
and community development programs through HUD, as our 
ranking member said, over 30 specifically geared towards affordable 
housing programs. 

And so today our committee response is not necessarily to improve 
or reform the old programs but instead to create a new program 
on top of the 80 that already exist. The second response of

business, FHA programs helped us to serve many borrowers 
who otherwise could not get a loan. Today, the story is very different. 
In 2003, FHA made up approximately 16 percent of our 
overall production. Last year, however, only a little more than 1 
percent of our business went to FHA. While the mortgage market 
has grown significantly, our use of the FHA program has dropped 
precipitously. Lenders have progressed, reacting to quickly changing 
and efficient technology. Unfortunately, FHA has not. While 
the needs of low- and moderate-income home buyers, of first-time 
home buyers, and of senior homeowners have changed, FHA has

NHTF Hearing.txt," would like to end with a story that drives home why I think 
housing can be a medical intervention and can make kids better 
and keep them healthy. In my pediatric practice, I take care of a 
child, Whitney, whom I met when she was 9 months old. Her family 
was homeless at the time because they could not afford an 
apartment. 

At the time, she was falling off her growth chart. She already 
was having trouble growing. And over the next 3 months, she literally 
gained less than a pound. I needed to hospitalize her because 
she had become dangerously malnourished. 

She ended up needing to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 
because she had an underlying problem with swallowing, and 
she stayed there for over a month. You can imagine the cost of that 
to insurance. When she was at the rehabilitation hospital, she was 
able to gain weight, but as soon as she went back to the shelter, 
she began to lose weight again. 

After advocating with lawyers from our medico-legal partnership 
at Boston Medical Center, Whitney and her family were finally offered 
an affordable home at a local public housing development. 
Once in her new apartment and she was living there, she was able 
to gain weight, and within months her developmental delays improved 
and she was able to thrive. I recently saw Whitney at her 
physical a few months ago, and at 4 years old, she was starting to 
learn to read. 

I tried my best to treat Whitney. I gave her all my medical expertise, 
including very expensive medical care during hospitalizations.

made her well, was a safe, decent, affordable home.",12

NHTF Hearing.txt,"A couple of last comments on the big picture here. Why is this 
so important to us as a country? More than 25 years ago, the 
Catholic Bishops of the United States issued a pastoral letter 
called, ‘‘The Right to a Decent Home.’’ It described decent housing 
as a human right and said its provision involved public responsibility 
and the partnership between private enterprise and government. ",12
CHRG-107hhrg77785.htm,"A few years ago it seemed to me we were close to a 
consensus among policymakers that essentially all you needed to 
do was to remove the restrictions on capital and let capital 
find its most profitable niche anywhere in the world, and we 
would be, on the whole, better off. I think that that has been 
disproven by a good number of events. Clearly, the thrust of 
the New Deal was to say, yes, we want capital to be able to 
find its best area of return, but not without other factors 
being taken into account. Again, it's much harder to do that 
internationally.
    Argentina for a while was an example of the success of a 
fairly unrestrained capitalism. And what we have seen now is 
that in the global economy, that is not enough. And this is the 
point we have to make--no matter what people think about the 
appropriate public policy, there is a reaction now within 
Argentina politically to people have perceived to be that 
fairly unrestrained capitalist model that may be going further 
than is reasonable. Certainly, it's going further than is 
reasonable in many people's minds. And you see these 
connections. This Administration has made a free trade 
agreement for the Americas a high priority. That's endangered 
in part by the political reaction you are seeing in Argentina.
    So this, to me, is part of an ongoing effort to try to find 
a way to harmonize support for the capitalist system with 
attention to the kind of policy issues that Franklin Roosevelt 
successfully launched here in the United States. And unless we 
can come up with a better balance, I think we will continue to 
have these problems. I would just point out I was encouraged to 
see in the world economic forum in New York City, at least as 
it was reported to me--I wasn't there--the discussion was 
somewhat different and I would say more balanced than it had 
been before. There was more concern about the social aspect. 
And this is our challenge: How do you maintain globally a 
system in which capital is free to do its job of creating 
wealth, but not in a way that so exacerbates tensions and 
inequality either within countries or between countries where, 
ultimately, popular resistance will bring it down?",12
NHTF Hearing.txt,"Agreeing with that, we responded by saying, yes, we will take a 
small percentage of the money that they make, far less than they 
get from these advantages, and require it to go to affordable housing. 
Having done that, some of the same people who told us we 
were letting Fannie and Freddie get away with murder now say we 
are being unfair to the murderers. 

Somehow it is no longer a case of Fannie and Freddie getting too 
much from these advantages, but us preying on these poor, 
unsuspecting private corporations. They are not wholly private corporations. 
They are quasi-public entities and we think that the alternative 
of reducing the advantages they get and diminishing the 
amount of money that’s available for housing is not a good one. The 
other choice, of course, is to leave the status quo in which they get 
more benefit than they should and that they pay back. ",12

CHRG-107hhrg77785.htm,"And it is the question 
of how do you promote policies in the world that increase 
prosperity without so exacerbating inequality that social 
tensions reach the point where it interferes with progress?
    We've got a worldwide consensus that capitalism is without 
question the best way to generate wealth. There was a few years 
ago a consensus that said in addition to a capitalist system, 
you needed to make that work by a very minimalist public sector 
approach. And that I think has been called into question by 
events. When Franklin Roosevelt became President, he made the 
decision to try to preserve the capitalist system. There were 
some hems and haws in how he ultimately decided to do that. But 
the notion was that we would have the capitalist system plus a 
Government role involving some regulation and some intervention 
to provide social equity.
    Our challenge today is to try and duplicate that kind of 
approach on the global scale. Now it's extremely harder. You're 
not dealing with one sovereignty. But it's the same kind of 
intellectual problem. How do you give full rein to the 
capitalist system, which after all depends on inequality to 
work, if you do not have people unequally rewarded according to 
how hard they work, how smart they invest, how cunningly they 
anticipate public needs, and so forth? Then you don't get the 
wealth creation. What I believe and many others, and I think 
this was what Franklin Roosevelt argued, there is a point 
beyond which the inequality can become dysfunctional. That it 
can be more than is necessary to give the proper incentives. 
There is also a need for some forms of regulation.",12

Currently only 46 percent of African Americans own their own 
homes, compared to more than 70 percent of white Americans. Perhaps 
more troubling than that statistic, however, is the disparate 
number of African Americans who spend too much of their income, 
which is already at the low end of the wage scale, on housing and 
utilities. 

The most current numbers we have indicate that 23 percent of 
African Americans fall into the extremely-low-income category. 
These men, women, children, and families have severe housing 
needs. In other words, they spend more than 50 percent of their income 
of housing and utilities.

In summary, half of all African Americans live in unaffordable, 
inadequate, and/or crowded housing. But of course, this is not only 
a problem for African Americans. Seventy-one percent of Hispanic

heads or food on their tables.

that there was a deficit of two million extremely-low-income rental 
units. In 2005, that deficit had grown to four million. 
In 2003, HUD estimated that there were 44 affordable rental 
units available for every 100 extremely-low-income families. That 
number dropped to 40 units available in 2005, and the number continues 
to worsen. 

Unfortunately, the number of extremely-low-income households

GSE hearing.txt,"First, the GSEs need a strong regulator and sound corporate governance. 
Regulatory oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 
Federal Home Loan Bank should be transferred to a new regulator

which has the authority to set capital standards, liquidate a financially 
unstable enterprise, and approve new programs and products. 
The regulators should also understand and support the GSEs’ 
vital housing finance mission and the role housing plays in supporting 
our national economy. 

Realtors also support legislative efforts to strengthen the governance 
of the Federal Home Loan Banks, by raising the number of 
independent directors, adding community and economic development 
expertise, and allowing appointed independent directors to 
continue their service until a successor is in place. 

Second, the GSEs’ vital housing mission should be preserved and 
protected. This mission ensures that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
provide capital to the market during downturns, and use their Federal 
ties to facilitate mortgage finance, and support homeownership 
opportunities. The GSEs’ housing mission is vital to the continued 
success of the housing market. Realtors will oppose legislative proposals 
which diminish that. 

Third, the GSEs must be able to develop new products and programs 
that respond to market needs. The standards for approving 
new products and programs should be those contained in the Federal 
National Mortgage Association Charter Act, and the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act. We support requiring the 
GSEs to provide notice to the regulator, so that adequate safety, 
soundness, and mission review can be accomplished. 

We oppose requirements that could unduly delay or prevent the 
GSEs from developing new programs and products that support 
their missions. 

Fourth, there should be no overly restrictive bright line test that 
explicitly limits the GSEs’ role in the secondary market, strictly defined. 
Realtors believe such a test would seriously hinder important 
mission-related consumer outreach activities now supported by the 
GSEs, such as home buyer education. 

Fifth, portfolio limits should be regulated, and not legislated. The 
GSEs’ retained portfolios help support affordable housing programs, 
and also help provide financing for low-income borrowers. 
For example, Freddie Mac reports that approximately 300 million 
of the mortgages in the retained portfolio qualify under their affordable 
housing goals. We believe the best way to ensure safety is 
for a strong regulator to limit portfolio risk, and moderate portfolio 
growth, when appropriate. 

Finally, Realtors support increasing the conforming loan limits 
for high-cost areas, and we would like to thank Chairman Frank 
and Representative Miller for their support on this important 
issue, and for including the Miller amendment language in H.R. 
1427. ",12

NHTF Hearing.txt,"I must again express my adamant opposition to this legislation 
and the idea here of creating what is called the Affordable 
Housing Fund. As I have expressed since its inception, this fund 
is straight out of Central Planning 101. This is really a step in the 
wrong direction. 

There appears here to be a clear conflict of vision. I think past 
government housing programs have actually done very little, if you 
look at the record, to increase homeownership levels in this country. 
We do not have much to show for the tens of billions of dollars 
we spent on housing through HUD and FHA, but there is a way 
to improve homeownership rates. 

They improve when real interest rates are low and when consumer 
incomes are high. Under that kind of an environment people 
can afford to frankly get into a position where they can buy their 
own home. I believe limited government and free market policies 
will generate these results; creeping socialism will not. It will work 
more as an anchor on the economy and prosperity. It will keep the 
private sector from becoming as vibrant and creating the opportunities 
for people so that they can move up. 

This fund will waste resources. It’s going to provide false hope 
for those who wish to increase homeownership. Additionally this 
fund will create a terrible precedent, a terrible, terrible precedent

NHTF Hearing.txt,"If I could just add one quick things about schools. 
You are absolutely right that the data all show that children whose 
families can’t afford basic housing are in constant motion, and so 
they are moving from school to school, which means they get further 
and further behind. 

But it is not just the kids who are moving that are affected. It 
is the other kids in the classroom and the teachers because when 
you have a lot of churning in schools and you have new kids coming 
into the classroom mid-year, two or three times a year, the 
teachers have to double back to pick those kids up, which means 
the other kids are getting less attention. 

And it ultimately means that those schools, their test scores 
don’t keep up. Their test scores go down, which means that higher-
income people aren’t going to go to that school. It all has a spiraling-
down effect, so I think that it is important to understand the 
systematic impact beyond the individual child to the entire educational 
system. And there is a fair amount of research in the education 
literature that really gets at all of that. ",12

NHTF Hearing.txt,"Madam Chairwoman. Madam Chairwoman, 
I must again express my adamant opposition to this legislation 
and the idea here of creating what is called the Affordable 
Housing Fund. As I have expressed since its inception, this fund 
is straight out of Central Planning 101. This is really a step in the 
wrong direction. 

There appears here to be a clear conflict of vision. I think past 
government housing programs have actually done very little, if you 
look at the record, to increase homeownership levels in this country. 
We do not have much to show for the tens of billions of dollars 
we spent on housing through HUD and FHA, but there is a way 
to improve homeownership rates. 

They improve when real interest rates are low and when consumer 
incomes are high. Under that kind of an environment people 
can afford to frankly get into a position where they can buy their 
own home. I believe limited government and free market policies 
will generate these results; creeping socialism will not. It will work 
more as an anchor on the economy and prosperity. It will keep the 
private sector from becoming as vibrant and creating the opportunities 
for people so that they can move up. 

This fund will waste resources. It’s going to provide false hope 
for those who wish to increase homeownership. Additionally this 
fund will create a terrible precedent, a terrible, terrible precedent 
for other industries in this country. As I said during the GSE and 


9 


FHA debates, I hope that other financial institutions are watching 
this debate because you’re going to be the next targets. 

Proponents of this concept are not going to stop at just assessing 
or taxing GSEs and the Federal Housing Administration. They’re 
going to try to confiscate money once they set up this fund from 
any source they can get it. ",13

CHRG-108hhrg89932.htm,"many of us were alarmed when we learned that the Administration 
was not desirous of reauthorizing HOPE VI. As you know, we all 
have concerns about public housing--the funding for public 
housing, section 8, making more units available, rehab--all of 
that. But HOPE VI has taken on quite a significant meaning for 
distressed housing in this country. While the Administration 
makes the argument that not all of the dollars allocated to 
HOPE VI have been spent, our examination of this issue does not 
lead us to conclude that this is a good reason why HOPE VI 
should not be reauthorized.
    We have learned that the number of applications for it 
outweigh any concerns about whether it is needed. As a matter 
of fact, we believe that if we simply fund it at about 50 
percent of those applications that have been put in, we would 
be going a long way toward providing safe affordable housing 
for so many of our citizens who are in desperate need. Not only 
are we concerned about the lack of reauthorization, we think 
this sends a message. We do not know why, even if you did not 
want to put the dollars into it, if the Administration did not 
want to put the dollars into it, we do not know why you would 
not simply support reauthorization. That is a signal that says, 
we think this program has value. We think that despite the fact 
that all of the dollars have not been spent, we do see progress 
being made.
    We have discovered in our examination of the issue that 
increasingly the housing authorities have reduced the number of 
days that it has taken them to get up to speed, and we think it 
gets even better. We think with the more involvement of the 
private sector and all of that, that these grants can be 
expedited in ways that can put the rehabilitation of housing 
units on line in ways, again, that would make them available to 
people who so desperately need it.

if we’re going to have Federal housing programs, we have all sorts

average are poorer, and according to the 2000 census, the poverty 
rate in rural America is 14 percent higher than the national rate. 

Likewise, Delaware’s rural counties have higher poverty rates 
than the State average, and experience similar conditions. For instance, 
57 percent of all workers statewide have insufficient income 
to afford a two-bedroom apartment in their county of employment. 

There is a deficit in this small State of 12,000 affordable housing 
units for those with extremely low incomes. A majority of Delaware’s 
20,000 substandard housing units in need of major repair or 
actual repayment exist in rural counties. And the median incomes 
in our rural counties are 30 percent lower than our metro county. 

In face of this need, rural housing spending for USDA programs

They are quasi-public entities and we think that the alternative 
of reducing the advantages they get and diminishing the 
amount of money that’s available for housing is not a good one. The 
other choice, of course, is to leave the status quo in which they get 
more benefit than they should and that they pay back. 

And we’ve taken what we think is the middle course. We leave 
the benefits, although with greatly increased regulation, but we use 
some of that money for good public purpose. Similarly with the 
FHA, our bill, contrary to suggestions that it’s going to lead to FHA 
fee increases, in the bill that our committee passed we seek to prevent 
the Bush Administration from increasing FHA fees not because 
there is a need to do that to do FHA business but to help 
benefit the general Treasury. 

And section 30 of the bill would prohibit HUD from increasing 
any FHA premium above the level that was in effect at the beginning 
of this fiscal year unless the Secretary shows that in the absence 
of an increase the program would require a subsidy from the 
Congress. So we, in fact, strengthen the resistance to FHA fee increases, 
and that applies to what we’re doing here. 

If anything in this legislation that we have passed on the FHA 
that would get incorporated here were to cause a fee increase that 
would kick in. So we in fact prohibit fee increases. In fact our bill 
says no money goes to the housing fund if it were threatened, a fee 
increase. So the truth is that the bill that we passed already on the 
FHA, and it’s all part of one package conceptually, prevents a fee 
increase that is being contemplated.

Although I do not question people’s motives and I believe their 
hearts and motives are pure, many on this committee with their

housing more affordable, we need to realize there is no greater

new jobs created. And yet many in this House and many on the

the tax relief, you begin to take away the jobs. 

Secondly, if we truly care about affordable housing, we need to 
realize how the single largest tax increase in American history contained 
within the Democrat budget resolution, how that impacts 
families who are trying to make their homes affordable.

increased $2,755, we would not be able to pay our mortgage.’’ And

fuels more taxes which makes homes less affordable.

some, make housing less affordable for many low- and middle-income 
Americans because we know that Fannie Mae and Freddie

you are at about $26. And at 3 percent, you are at roughly $39.95 
or so. So the difference is not much. Now the $225,000 figure in 
this room sounds like a low amount. But as Congressman 
Neugebauer from Texas knows, that is a big home in the South and 
in the Midwest and in other parts of the country. As a matter of 
fact, 75 percent of our mortgages currently are below $150,000.

around a $130,000 mortgage. So the $225,000 example is

NHTF Hearing.txt,"While I commend this committee’s goal of increasing the amount 
of available, affordable housing, I do not believe that H.R. 2895 is 
an efficient means to achieve it. And I’ll make three quick points 
to expand on this. First, because the trust fund is financed through 
self-defeating provisions in both the GSE reform bill and the FHA 
reauthorization bill, low- and middle-income Americans, including 
the elderly, will have to foot the bill. 

Specifically, it’s estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
two entities that purchased or securitized almost 80 percent of 
American families’ mortgages, will be taxed more than $3 billion 
over a 5-year period to help pay for the trust fund. As publicly 
traded companies accountable to their shareholders, Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac will inevitably seek to pass along these new assessments 
to their customers, America’s low- and middle-income 
homeowners. 

This is unacceptable and will result in what amounts to a mortgage 
tax on these hardworking low- and middle-income Americans 
seeking to secure, maintain, or refinance their home mortgages. To 
me, it’s robbing Peter to save Paul. 

And then second, CBO has estimated that FHA reauthorization 
bill could result in a $370 million surplus in 2008 and a $2.1 billion 
surplus over the 2008 to 2012 period. Now normally we would say 
that the surplus is a good thing, but not in this case. In this case 
the surplus would come through overcharging seniors on their reverse 
mortgages, and I don’t think that’s right. 


7 


By far the majority of this FHA surplus would come from reverse 
mortgages premiums paid by our seniors, suggesting that they 
have been overcharged. As you know I have supported the ideas 
aimed at giving the surplus back to our seniors in the form of reduced 
premiums, which this committee rejected. By using the reverse 
mortgage product as a moneymaker to finance a National 
Housing Trust Fund, this bill instead instructs FHA to continue 
overcharging and essentially taxing our seniors. Our seniors deserve 
better. 

At the same time, this bill removes all surplus funds out of FHA, 
which I believe threatens the solvency of the FHA fund and its 
ability to pay out on insurance claims. 

Third, a National Housing Trust Fund unnecessarily adds another 
Federal housing program to the over 100 programs that already 
exist. The National Low Income Housing Coalition cites 
nearly 600 housing trust funds that have been created in cities, 
counties, and States of this country generating more than $1.6 billion 
per year to support housing needs. 

For example, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund in Illinois allocates 
approximately $16 million to $20 million each year to benefit 
low- and very-low-income households. Additionally, the Illinois 
Rental Housing Support Program provides rent subsidies for an estimated 
4,000 rent burdened households. 

I think that these regionally tailored programs work best because 
they allow funds to be tailored to localized housing and community 
development needs. Also, to the extent that Federal programs fall 
short in some way, I must point out the existing federally administered 
program designed to serve the housing needs of low-income 
Americans, the Home Investment Partnership Program. This program 
already has the personnel, systems, and regulatory oversight 
in place to accomplish the same objectives as the National Housing 
Trust Fund. 

Rather than create a new Federal bureaucracy to address low-income 
housing availability, we should instead focus our efforts on 
improving the HOME program. ",13
