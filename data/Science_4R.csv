NHTF Hearing.txt," am also here today to share new evidence that shows that 
housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may

and do not more frequently have better child development outcomes

NHTF Hearing.txt," And since we have 
enacted pro-growth tax policies in 2003, we have had 8.2 million 
new jobs created. And yet many in this House and many on the 
committee want the tax relief to go away. And, as you take away 
the tax relief, you begin to take away the jobs. 

Secondly, if we truly care about affordable housing, we need to 
realize how the single largest tax increase in American history contained 
within the Democrat budget resolution, how that impacts 
families who are trying to make their homes affordable. 

I hear from constituents in my district. I hear from the Brucker 
Family in Wills Point who writes, ‘‘No increase in taxes. My family 
is only one breath away from losing our home as it is.’’ 

I hear from the Stevens Family in Forney, Texas, ‘‘If our taxes 
increased $2,755, we would not be able to pay our mortgage.’’ And 
the list goes on and on and on. We need to realize that more spending 
fuels more taxes which makes homes less affordable. 

Third, it seems ironic to me that we would increase taxes on 
some, make housing less affordable for many low- and middle-income 
Americans because we know that Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac are an effectively a government protected duopoly. They have 
great economic power to simply pass along these fees or taxes, if 
you will, ultimately to the consumer. And so this is a mortgage tax, 
pure and simple. ",33
CHRG-109hhrg30537.htm," And the other problem is that our national housing policy

I guess one problem I have is—I’m not arguing but I have a real 
problem with the comment you made on the downpayment assistance

shows that the number of low-income—and many of the families 
who will be targeted by this fund, the number of families who need 
that sort of assistance has gone up. 

Sadly that has gone up by 800,000 families between 2003 and 
2005. It’s one of the reasons why we have proposed as part of our

One of the areas that again is of most concern to me is housing

Another aspect of the bill that I think is excellent is the local 
flexibility. From my experience working in Boston with the Boston 
Public Health Commission, local community development corporations, 
and some State-funded housing developments, the ability for 
State or local governments to match the best local solution to the 
greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I 
urge you to support H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing 
Trust Fund bill, because it can ensure that our most vulnerable 
population, our children, have safe, decent, and affordable homes. ",32

    Our primary concern with H.R. 5039, Mr. Chairman, is the 
fact that it, in fact, would potentially displace 110,000 
people, of which 50 percent are elderly and 10 percent are 
people with disabilities. We are extremely concerned about 
that. It puts the residents at the pleasure of the 
Congressional budget process, and at the pleasure of the 
Administration not potentially asking for sufficient funds to 
protect against displacement. We do not believe that should be 
happening.",32
CHRG-109hhrg30537.htm," I'd like to briefly share with the committee one of the 
most interesting observations of the study, ``If new funds are 
not invested in these properties, two-thirds of the portfolio 
will only be able to maintain its current status, which keep in 
mind is not good already for the majority properties. If the 
roofs never leak, the paint jobs last forever, the building 
siding is everlasting, no potholes ever develop in the parking 
lot, no one will ever need to replace a furnace or air 
conditioner, no doors will ever rust or rot, and all windows 
will work forever.''",32
HR1892 hearing.txt," In 2006—is that better—1.2 million families entered 
into foreclosure, 42 percent more than in 2005. Predatory 
lending, exotic mortgages, and a dramatic rise in subprime lend-
ing,coupled with slowing home price appreciation have all contributed 
to this crisis. When the Federal Housing Administration was 
established back in 1934, consumers faced a similar lending crisis. 
At that time, FHA was an innovator and led the private market 
in offering safe, affordable home loans to American families. Since 
its inception, FHA has insured more than 34 million properties. 
However, the FHA has failed to keep pace with borrower needs and 
changes in the private market and is no longer a viable alternative 
for many borrowers. At the same time, the subprime and non-traditional 
mortgage markets have boomed. Many of these loans offer 
low teaser rates which reset to much higher rates after a few years. 
In many cases, these borrowers qualified only on their ability to 
make the initial payment and face large prepayment penalties if 
they attempt to refinance. Mortgage experts estimate that approximately 
$1.5 trillion worth of adjustable mortgages will reset by the 
end of 2007. Faced with significantly higher monthly payments, 
many borrowers will face the possibility of losing their homes. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt," In a little 
over 10 years, Federal housing assistance has almost doubled from 
$15.4 billion in 1995 to more recently $30 billion in 2007. The rate 
of increase is higher than the Federal commitment that we have 
seen to veterans, education, energy, transportation, international 
affairs, or even Social Security over the same period. 

The Federal Government runs, I believe, over 80 different housing 
and community development programs through HUD, as our 
ranking member said, over 30 specifically geared towards affordable 
housing programs. 

And so today our committee response is not necessarily to improve 
or reform the old programs but instead to create a new program 
on top of the 80 that already exist. The second response of 
this committee apparently is to raise taxes on hardworking American 
people. Make no mistake about it. This bill would impose a 
very creative de facto mortgage tax on hardworking Americans trying 
to pay for their homes. ",32
NHTF Hearing.txt," in Alexandria, we have 
had a housing trust fund since 1993. Primarily, it was funded by 
developer voluntary contributions and then a few years ago, we 
dedicated one cent of our annual real estate tax rate to creating 
and continuing to fund our affordable housing trust fund. 

More recently, again through a public/private partnership, because 
Alexandria is so dense, but yet we have a critical need to 
meet our affordable housing objectives, we have the opportunity to 
build for the first time in more than 30 years a new fire station 
in our City, a new development area, and one of the solutions or 
compromise with the community in terms of building this four bay 
fire station was the need to ensure that we provided affordable 
housing and workforce housing. 

For the first time, we believe we are the first community in the 
Nation, we are building a new fire station that will have 64 units 
of public housing and workforce housing built on top of the fire station 
in a very growing community. ",33
HR1892 hearing.txt," In areas such as California, we have 
an FHA program that has been available for 70 years. And if you 
look at the drop in utilization in California because we are a high 
cost area, it is really stunning. In 2000, FHA insured 109,074 mortgages 
in California. In 2005, it was 51,037. In my district alone in 
2000, we had 7,000 mortgages. It dropped to 80. You are looking 
at a 99 percent drop in an area that arguably needs the benefit of 
an FHA program or a conforming program as much as any other 
State in the Nation does. In fact, in high cost areas it is much 
harder for people to get into",33
HR1892 hearing.txt," inviting 
me to share MBA’s views on reforming the FHA. I have spent over 
36 years working with FHA and have made billions of dollars in 
loan originations to families who have achieved the dream of home-
ownership through FHA’s programs. When I started in the mortgage 
business, FHA programs helped us to serve many borrowers 
who otherwise could not get a loan. Today, the story is very different. 
In 2003, FHA made up approximately 16 percent of our 
overall production. Last year, however, only a little more than 1 
percent of our business went to FHA. While the mortgage market 
has grown significantly, our use of the FHA program has dropped 
precipitously. Lenders have progressed, reacting to quickly changing 
and efficient technology. Unfortunately, FHA has not. While 
the needs of low- and moderate-income home buyers, of first-time 
home buyers, and of senior homeowners have changed, FHA has 
not followed its historic path of adopting to meet borrowers’ changing 
needs. ",32
HR1892 hearing.txt," Mr. Montgomery, like a lot of people, 
Baby Boomers at least, I came out of college and bought my 
first home with FHA, an $18,000 home. And at that time, everyone 
I knew buying homes were going through FHA. I think it served 
its purpose well. And, of course, today in your testimony when you 
talked about the drop in the FHA share of the market in Chairwoman 
Waters’ district, that just is mind-boggling. What I would 
like to ask or find out from you is Freddie Mac has said that they 
are going to buy up to $20 billion in subprime mortgages",32

Dream Down Payment Act, and only 19 percent to the housing 
counseling.
    Secretary Jackson. No, no. See, I think, Congresswoman, 
you're mixing apples and oranges. The American Dream Down 
Payment is to help people with the closing costs and down 
payment. It has nothing to do with housing counseling. Housing 
counseling--
    Ms. Velazquez. Of course, I know that. So, on the one hand, 
you are helping people to buy their homes, but on the other 
hand, you're not putting enough money to provide housing 
counseling to prevent foreclosure.
    Secretary Jackson. Well, I guess I disagree with you.
    Ms. Velazquez. Of course you're going to disagree with me. 
CBDG is cut by more than $700 million. Under the current 
distribution formula, New York City will lose $58 million. I 
understand that HUD is proposing a new formula. Will this make 
up for the cuts, and when can we expect to see this proposal?
    Secretary Jackson. Let me say this to you. I just answered 
that to the Congresswoman from West Virginia. We have cities 
that are receiving large sums of monies, that I really don't 
think should be receiving those monies. I think we should 
concentrate the block grant program to those cities most in 
need where we have the highest rate of poverty, where we have 
the highest rate of the ability to make substantial changes in 
the quality of life for people. And in this case, we are trying 
to reallocate that based on where we see the greatest poverty 
need, not pockets of poverties in wealthy areas. That's a 
totally different situation.
    So if we--if the proposal is accepted by Congress and 
passed, then, yes, I think that clearly those areas where the 
greatest needs are will be addressed.",32
HR1892 hearing.txt," My 
bill allows any FHA-qualified borrower to participate in the new 
FHA low loan program. Second, the Frank-Waters bill authorizes 
the FHA to implement risk-based pricing but it leaves in place the 
current outdated premium caps of 2.25 percent up-front and 0.55 percent annually. And the zero and lower down payment loans  would have the higher caps. My concern is that these limits on premium caps will prevent FHA from serving riskier borrowers who  could be prudently served by charging a slightly higher premium.  With the flexibility to charge slightly higher premiums, FHA would  be able to serve borrowers with the lower FICO scores who are currently  being served only by the subprime market at very high interest  rates. With FHA mortgage insurance, lenders will charge 
borrowers the market mortgage interest rate. Without FHA insurance, 
they have no choice but to turn the borrower away or to 
charge for a risk in an increased mortgage interest rate. ",33

unfortunate result certainly does not seem equitable or 
appropriate, and furthermore, the designation of BAH as income

Federal income tax purposes.

Homeownership is not only the key to financial independence,

NHTF Hearing.txt," would like to end with a story that drives home why I think 
housing can be a medical intervention and can make kids better 
and keep them healthy. In my pediatric practice, I take care of a 
child, Whitney, whom I met when she was 9 months old. Her family 
was homeless at the time because they could not afford an 
apartment. 

At the time, she was falling off her growth chart. She already 
was having trouble growing. And over the next 3 months, she literally 
gained less than a pound. I needed to hospitalize her because 
she had become dangerously malnourished. 

She ended up needing to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 
because she had an underlying problem with swallowing, and 
she stayed there for over a month. You can imagine the cost of that 
to insurance. When she was at the rehabilitation hospital, she was 
able to gain weight, but as soon as she went back to the shelter, 
she began to lose weight again. 

After advocating with lawyers from our medico-legal partnership 
at Boston Medical Center, Whitney and her family were finally offered 
an affordable home at a local public housing development. 
Once in her new apartment and she was living there, she was able 
to gain weight, and within months her developmental delays improved 
and she was able to thrive. I recently saw Whitney at her 
physical a few months ago, and at 4 years old, she was starting to 
learn to read. 

I tried my best to treat Whitney. I gave her all my medical expertise, 
including very expensive medical care during hospitalizations. 
But the best medical intervention for her, the one that eventually 
made her well, was a safe, decent, affordable home.",32

In fact, Chairman Bernanke, in a speech last week, noted, ‘‘Contrary 
to what would be expected if the GSE portfolios lowered the 
funding cost of mortgages, over the past decade or so the spread 
between yields on 30-year fixed rate mortgages and treasuries of 
similar duration has tended to rise in periods in which the GSEs 
have increased the share of single family residential mortgage held 
in their portfolio, and to fall when the GSE share has fallen.’’ 

He went on to specifically state, ‘‘Due to the GSEs’ support for 
affordable housing,’’ and he answered his own question by saying, 
‘‘At the present time, Fannie and Freddie fail the test.’’ ",32

Mr. CISNEROS. There is very solid scientific evidence that shows 
that children in stable housing do better, not just in school but psychologically 
and in other ways. There is actual medical evidence 
that shows health conditions improve with the decency and stability 
and safety of housing. Overcrowding, substandard conditions, 
unsafe housing, lead paint problems, all of those impact children. 

I think it was Sheila’s group that just published or at least published 
another group’s report that said that actually, among minorities,

Number one, we have seen the largest mortgage markets in history

It is incredibly important that the GSEs maintain some flexibility

Those who do manage to purchase a home face additional struggles. 
Studies show that minorities are 30 percent more likely to receive 
a higher priced loan than white borrowers, even after accounting 
for risk. 

Of course, housing affordability is not just a problem for minorities. 
People of all backgrounds are finding it harder and harder 
than ever to pay for housing. 

According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard 
University, more than one in seven U.S. households spend more 
than half their income on housing. 

Finding affordable rental housing is another growing problem. In 
the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, two million affordable housing 
units were lost. HUD estimated in 2005 that they were only 77 
units affordable and available for every 100 low-income renters. 

That means nearly a quarter of low-income families do not have 
access to decent rental housing. Whether you look at the facts or 
consider personal experiences, the conclusion is the same. Affordable 
housing is no longer merely a problem, it is a crisis, and we 
must all do our part to address it. ",33
CHRG-107hhrg77785.htm,"A few years ago it seemed to me we were close to a 
consensus among policymakers that essentially all you needed to 
do was to remove the restrictions on capital and let capital 
find its most profitable niche anywhere in the world, and we 
would be, on the whole, better off. I think that that has been 
disproven by a good number of events. Clearly, the thrust of 
the New Deal was to say, yes, we want capital to be able to 
find its best area of return, but not without other factors 
being taken into account. Again, it's much harder to do that 
internationally.
    Argentina for a while was an example of the success of a 
fairly unrestrained capitalism. And what we have seen now is 
that in the global economy, that is not enough. And this is the 
point we have to make--no matter what people think about the 
appropriate public policy, there is a reaction now within 
Argentina politically to people have perceived to be that 
fairly unrestrained capitalist model that may be going further 
than is reasonable. Certainly, it's going further than is 
reasonable in many people's minds. And you see these 
connections. This Administration has made a free trade 
agreement for the Americas a high priority. That's endangered 
in part by the political reaction you are seeing in Argentina.
    So this, to me, is part of an ongoing effort to try to find 
a way to harmonize support for the capitalist system with 
attention to the kind of policy issues that Franklin Roosevelt 
successfully launched here in the United States. And unless we 
can come up with a better balance, I think we will continue to 
have these problems. I would just point out I was encouraged to 
see in the world economic forum in New York City, at least as 
it was reported to me--I wasn't there--the discussion was 
somewhat different and I would say more balanced than it had 
been before. There was more concern about the social aspect. 
And this is our challenge: How do you maintain globally a 
system in which capital is free to do its job of creating 
wealth, but not in a way that so exacerbates tensions and 
inequality either within countries or between countries where, 
ultimately, popular resistance will bring it down?",32

problem we are facing in California is in the jumbo marketplace 
because the GSEs can't compete.
    And I thank, Mr. Frank, the chairman, for working with me. 
We've been trying for several years to raise, you know, limits 
in high-cost areas and introduce FHA in those high-cost areas. 
But on the jumbo market, 34.9 percent of the loans made in 2005 
were interest only, and 23.9 were negative ARMs. There's a 
problem there.
    Secretary Jackson. That's correct.
    Mr. Miller of California. And that's a problem we can do 
something about. We need to take and change the way the system 
has been going out there. We need to look at these high-cost 
areas and say how do we provide more opportunity for GSEs to 
compete in those areas and provide a good fixed-rate loan 
that's more affordable, more creative in some ways, and even an 
FHA to help people who don't have the down payment that they 
need to get into homes.
    What's your opinion on that? Where do think we've failed?
    Secretary Jackson. Well, first of all, let me say this, 
that you're correct. That's one of the reasons, I'll go back, 
that we need FHA modernization legislation, so we can address 
the needs of persons in California. In fact, Congressman, I'd 
say from Utah all the way back to California, from Virginia all 
the way back to the East Coast, we have the same problem. And

greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I 
urge you to support H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing

units available for every 100 extremely-low-income families. That 
number dropped to 40 units available in 2005, and the number continues 
to worsen. 

Unfortunately, the number of extremely-low-income households 
continues to grow as the number of affordable rental units decreases.

In Chicago, the goal is 5,500 rental subsidized units, not over 30 
percent of median income, to meet the city-wide goal of producing 
affordable housing. 

In smaller communities, many that are in high-cost areas, such 
as Boulder, Colorado, the explicit goal of the City is to use a housing 
trust fund to make sure that 10 percent of the housing stock 
is permanently affordable. In Boulder, that amounts to 2,700 units 
of which 2,100 would be rental, and 600 would be ownership. 

In another high-cost area, Mountain View, California, they are 
using the housing trust fund of Santa Clara County there where 
Catholic Charities just produced an award winning single room occupancy 
facility for people earning between $15,000 and $30,000 a

that only a housing trust fund makes possible.

NHTF Hearing.txt,"I am here today to support H.R. 2895, 
the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 

I am also here today to share new evidence that shows that 
housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may 


67 


frequently move. We know children who stay in the same home 
and do not more frequently have better child development outcomes 
and do better in school. 

Another aspect of the bill that I think is excellent is the local 
flexibility. From my experience working in Boston with the Boston 
Public Health Commission, local community development corporations, 
and some State-funded housing developments, the ability for 
State or local governments to match the best local solution to the 
greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I 
urge you to support H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing 
Trust Fund bill, because it can ensure that our most vulnerable 
population, our children, have safe, decent, and affordable homes. ",33

except they really don’t apply in most areas—particularly Pennsylvania, 
because Pennsylvania is a State of very small communities—
but, they are bunched up alongside other communities 
which are really tied into a very large community. 

By virtue of the fact of their structure, they have been barred 
from giving government guarantees, even in communities of 2,000 
or 3,000, if they are considered to be in an urban area, which nobody 
can quite define to me. They just have a map, and they say,

NHTF Hearing.txt,"If I could just add one quick things about schools. 
You are absolutely right that the data all show that children whose 
families can’t afford basic housing are in constant motion, and so 
they are moving from school to school, which means they get further 
and further behind. 

But it is not just the kids who are moving that are affected. It 
is the other kids in the classroom and the teachers because when 
you have a lot of churning in schools and you have new kids coming 
into the classroom mid-year, two or three times a year, the 
teachers have to double back to pick those kids up, which means 
the other kids are getting less attention. 

And it ultimately means that those schools, their test scores 
don’t keep up. Their test scores go down, which means that higher-
income people aren’t going to go to that school. It all has a spiraling-
down effect, so I think that it is important to understand the 
systematic impact beyond the individual child to the entire educational 
system. And there is a fair amount of research in the education 
literature that really gets at all of that. ",33

from 3 percent to 2.25 percent and the maximum annual fee from 

2.2 percent to .55 percent. These reductions will reduce FHA closing 
cost premiums for a hypothetical family buying a $300,000 
home by $2,250 in annual fees over a 5-year period of $20,000 compared 
to last year’s bill. 
The bill also adds a number of home buyer protections not included 
in last year’s bill for families taking out riskier zero-down 
payment loans and for borrowers who represent a higher credit 
risk. The bill gives HUD the authority to require pre-purchase 
counseling for riskier borrowers, requires a number of disclosures 
spelling out the costs and risk of zero down and lower down payment 
loans, and provides the borrower opt-in to receive notice of 
availability of counseling in the event a borrower falls behind in

percent of median income which is a key policy goal of the trust

formerly homeless families who now call Rollins Square their 
home, where they can get on with the business of living their lives. 

How could the trust fund have helped? Rollins Square was a $67 
million deal that required 14 separate sources of funds and had 
problems closing the last financial gap, delaying the project for 18 
months, which only drove up the costs more and created a cyclical 
problem.

could have unintended consequences of limiting the number of borrowers 
that could be served by the FHA program because it may 
require initial premiums to be even higher. The refund provision 
would also be very difficult to implement. It is inevitable in an insurance 
fund that lower risk borrowers will subsidize higher risk 
borrowers. Refunds of this nature undercut the concept of insurance

this room sounds like a low amount. But as Congressman 
Neugebauer from Texas knows, that is a big home in the South and 
in the Midwest and in other parts of the country. As a matter of 
fact, 75 percent of our mortgages currently are below $150,000. 
And the average cost on average, the median for FHA, is somewhere 
around a $130,000 mortgage. So the $225,000 example is 
half that for the lower income—or the lower priced home. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt,"Well, speaking of FHA receipts, again this 
committee has done great work on the FHA bill and I appreciate 
it, but as it stands today, no FHA bill, I am looking at being $143 
million in the red for the first time in FHA’s history in Fiscal Year 
2008. Now we all know why that has happened. That die was cast 
many years ago and I know this committee is trying to fix it. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt,"While I commend this committee’s goal of increasing the amount 
of available, affordable housing, I do not believe that H.R. 2895 is 
an efficient means to achieve it. And I’ll make three quick points 
to expand on this. First, because the trust fund is financed through 
self-defeating provisions in both the GSE reform bill and the FHA 
reauthorization bill, low- and middle-income Americans, including 
the elderly, will have to foot the bill. 

Specifically, it’s estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
two entities that purchased or securitized almost 80 percent of 
American families’ mortgages, will be taxed more than $3 billion 
over a 5-year period to help pay for the trust fund. As publicly 
traded companies accountable to their shareholders, Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac will inevitably seek to pass along these new assessments 
to their customers, America’s low- and middle-income 
homeowners. 

This is unacceptable and will result in what amounts to a mortgage 
tax on these hardworking low- and middle-income Americans 
seeking to secure, maintain, or refinance their home mortgages. To 
me, it’s robbing Peter to save Paul. 

And then second, CBO has estimated that FHA reauthorization 
bill could result in a $370 million surplus in 2008 and a $2.1 billion 
surplus over the 2008 to 2012 period. Now normally we would say 
that the surplus is a good thing, but not in this case. In this case 
the surplus would come through overcharging seniors on their reverse 
mortgages, and I don’t think that’s right.

By far the majority of this FHA surplus would come from reverse 
mortgages premiums paid by our seniors, suggesting that they 
have been overcharged. As you know I have supported the ideas 
aimed at giving the surplus back to our seniors in the form of reduced 
premiums, which this committee rejected. By using the reverse 
mortgage product as a moneymaker to finance a National 
Housing Trust Fund, this bill instead instructs FHA to continue 
overcharging and essentially taxing our seniors. Our seniors deserve 
better. 

At the same time, this bill removes all surplus funds out of FHA, 
which I believe threatens the solvency of the FHA fund and its 
ability to pay out on insurance claims. 

Third, a National Housing Trust Fund unnecessarily adds another 
Federal housing program to the over 100 programs that already 
exist. The National Low Income Housing Coalition cites 
nearly 600 housing trust funds that have been created in cities, 
counties, and States of this country generating more than $1.6 billion 
per year to support housing needs. 

For example, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund in Illinois allocates 
approximately $16 million to $20 million each year to benefit 
low- and very-low-income households. Additionally, the Illinois 
Rental Housing Support Program provides rent subsidies for an estimated 
4,000 rent burdened households. 

I think that these regionally tailored programs work best because 
they allow funds to be tailored to localized housing and community 
development needs. Also, to the extent that Federal programs fall 
short in some way, I must point out the existing federally administered 
program designed to serve the housing needs of low-income 
Americans, the Home Investment Partnership Program. This program 
already has the personnel, systems, and regulatory oversight 
in place to accomplish the same objectives as the National Housing 
Trust Fund. 

Rather than create a new Federal bureaucracy to address low-income 
housing availability, we should instead focus our efforts on 
improving the HOME program. ",33
GSE hearing.txt,"While the 2007 national cap of $417,000 exceeds the local median 
for the vast majority of housing markets, it is considerably below 
the local median in a few high-cost metropolitan areas. Regional 
adjustments will help more low- and moderate-income working 
families in high-cost areas qualify for conforming GSE loans. They 
will also expand access to FHA and VA mortgages, since those limits 
are tied to the conforming ceiling, and give homebuyers access 
to safer mortgages. ",33
