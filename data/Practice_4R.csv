NHTF Hearing.txt," am also here today to share new evidence that shows that 
housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may

and do not more frequently have better child development outcomes

NHTF Hearing.txt," And since we have 
enacted pro-growth tax policies in 2003, we have had 8.2 million 
new jobs created. And yet many in this House and many on the 
committee want the tax relief to go away. And, as you take away 
the tax relief, you begin to take away the jobs. 

Secondly, if we truly care about affordable housing, we need to 
realize how the single largest tax increase in American history contained 
within the Democrat budget resolution, how that impacts 
families who are trying to make their homes affordable. 

I hear from constituents in my district. I hear from the Brucker 
Family in Wills Point who writes, ‘‘No increase in taxes. My family 
is only one breath away from losing our home as it is.’’ 

I hear from the Stevens Family in Forney, Texas, ‘‘If our taxes 
increased $2,755, we would not be able to pay our mortgage.’’ And 
the list goes on and on and on. We need to realize that more spending 
fuels more taxes which makes homes less affordable. 

Third, it seems ironic to me that we would increase taxes on 
some, make housing less affordable for many low- and middle-income 
Americans because we know that Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac are an effectively a government protected duopoly. They have 
great economic power to simply pass along these fees or taxes, if 
you will, ultimately to the consumer. And so this is a mortgage tax, 
pure and simple. ",33
CHRG-109hhrg30537.htm," And the other problem is that our national housing policy

I guess one problem I have is—I’m not arguing but I have a real 
problem with the comment you made on the downpayment assistance

shows that the number of low-income—and many of the families 
who will be targeted by this fund, the number of families who need 
that sort of assistance has gone up. 

Sadly that has gone up by 800,000 families between 2003 and 
2005. It’s one of the reasons why we have proposed as part of our

One of the areas that again is of most concern to me is housing

Another aspect of the bill that I think is excellent is the local 
flexibility. From my experience working in Boston with the Boston 
Public Health Commission, local community development corporations, 
and some State-funded housing developments, the ability for 
State or local governments to match the best local solution to the 
greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I 
urge you to support H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing 
Trust Fund bill, because it can ensure that our most vulnerable 
population, our children, have safe, decent, and affordable homes. ",32

    Our primary concern with H.R. 5039, Mr. Chairman, is the 
fact that it, in fact, would potentially displace 110,000 
people, of which 50 percent are elderly and 10 percent are 
people with disabilities. We are extremely concerned about 
that. It puts the residents at the pleasure of the 
Congressional budget process, and at the pleasure of the 
Administration not potentially asking for sufficient funds to 
protect against displacement. We do not believe that should be 
happening.",32
CHRG-109hhrg30537.htm," I'd like to briefly share with the committee one of the 
most interesting observations of the study, ``If new funds are 
not invested in these properties, two-thirds of the portfolio 
will only be able to maintain its current status, which keep in 
mind is not good already for the majority properties. If the 
roofs never leak, the paint jobs last forever, the building 
siding is everlasting, no potholes ever develop in the parking 
lot, no one will ever need to replace a furnace or air 
conditioner, no doors will ever rust or rot, and all windows 
will work forever.''",32
HR1892 hearing.txt," In 2006—is that better—1.2 million families entered 
into foreclosure, 42 percent more than in 2005. Predatory 
lending, exotic mortgages, and a dramatic rise in subprime lend-
ing,coupled with slowing home price appreciation have all contributed 
to this crisis. When the Federal Housing Administration was 
established back in 1934, consumers faced a similar lending crisis. 
At that time, FHA was an innovator and led the private market 
in offering safe, affordable home loans to American families. Since 
its inception, FHA has insured more than 34 million properties. 
However, the FHA has failed to keep pace with borrower needs and 
changes in the private market and is no longer a viable alternative 
for many borrowers. At the same time, the subprime and non-traditional 
mortgage markets have boomed. Many of these loans offer 
low teaser rates which reset to much higher rates after a few years. 
In many cases, these borrowers qualified only on their ability to 
make the initial payment and face large prepayment penalties if 
they attempt to refinance. Mortgage experts estimate that approximately 
$1.5 trillion worth of adjustable mortgages will reset by the 
end of 2007. Faced with significantly higher monthly payments, 
many borrowers will face the possibility of losing their homes. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt," In a little 
over 10 years, Federal housing assistance has almost doubled from 
$15.4 billion in 1995 to more recently $30 billion in 2007. The rate 
of increase is higher than the Federal commitment that we have 
seen to veterans, education, energy, transportation, international 
affairs, or even Social Security over the same period. 

The Federal Government runs, I believe, over 80 different housing 
and community development programs through HUD, as our 
ranking member said, over 30 specifically geared towards affordable 
housing programs. 

And so today our committee response is not necessarily to improve 
or reform the old programs but instead to create a new program 
on top of the 80 that already exist. The second response of 
this committee apparently is to raise taxes on hardworking American 
people. Make no mistake about it. This bill would impose a 
very creative de facto mortgage tax on hardworking Americans trying 
to pay for their homes. ",32
NHTF Hearing.txt," in Alexandria, we have 
had a housing trust fund since 1993. Primarily, it was funded by 
developer voluntary contributions and then a few years ago, we 
dedicated one cent of our annual real estate tax rate to creating 
and continuing to fund our affordable housing trust fund. 

More recently, again through a public/private partnership, because 
Alexandria is so dense, but yet we have a critical need to 
meet our affordable housing objectives, we have the opportunity to 
build for the first time in more than 30 years a new fire station 
in our City, a new development area, and one of the solutions or 
compromise with the community in terms of building this four bay 
fire station was the need to ensure that we provided affordable 
housing and workforce housing. 

For the first time, we believe we are the first community in the 
Nation, we are building a new fire station that will have 64 units 
of public housing and workforce housing built on top of the fire station 
in a very growing community. ",33
HR1892 hearing.txt," In areas such as California, we have 
an FHA program that has been available for 70 years. And if you 
look at the drop in utilization in California because we are a high 
cost area, it is really stunning. In 2000, FHA insured 109,074 mortgages 
in California. In 2005, it was 51,037. In my district alone in 
2000, we had 7,000 mortgages. It dropped to 80. You are looking 
at a 99 percent drop in an area that arguably needs the benefit of 
an FHA program or a conforming program as much as any other 
State in the Nation does. In fact, in high cost areas it is much 
harder for people to get into",33
HR1892 hearing.txt," inviting 
me to share MBA’s views on reforming the FHA. I have spent over 
36 years working with FHA and have made billions of dollars in 
loan originations to families who have achieved the dream of home-
ownership through FHA’s programs. When I started in the mortgage 
business, FHA programs helped us to serve many borrowers 
who otherwise could not get a loan. Today, the story is very different. 
In 2003, FHA made up approximately 16 percent of our 
overall production. Last year, however, only a little more than 1 
percent of our business went to FHA. While the mortgage market 
has grown significantly, our use of the FHA program has dropped 
precipitously. Lenders have progressed, reacting to quickly changing 
and efficient technology. Unfortunately, FHA has not. While 
the needs of low- and moderate-income home buyers, of first-time 
home buyers, and of senior homeowners have changed, FHA has 
not followed its historic path of adopting to meet borrowers’ changing 
needs. ",32
HR1892 hearing.txt," Mr. Montgomery, like a lot of people, 
Baby Boomers at least, I came out of college and bought my 
first home with FHA, an $18,000 home. And at that time, everyone 
I knew buying homes were going through FHA. I think it served 
its purpose well. And, of course, today in your testimony when you 
talked about the drop in the FHA share of the market in Chairwoman 
Waters’ district, that just is mind-boggling. What I would 
like to ask or find out from you is Freddie Mac has said that they 
are going to buy up to $20 billion in subprime mortgages",32

Dream Down Payment Act, and only 19 percent to the housing 
counseling.
    Secretary Jackson. No, no. See, I think, Congresswoman, 
you're mixing apples and oranges. The American Dream Down 
Payment is to help people with the closing costs and down 
payment. It has nothing to do with housing counseling. Housing 
counseling--
    Ms. Velazquez. Of course, I know that. So, on the one hand, 
you are helping people to buy their homes, but on the other 
hand, you're not putting enough money to provide housing 
counseling to prevent foreclosure.
    Secretary Jackson. Well, I guess I disagree with you.
    Ms. Velazquez. Of course you're going to disagree with me. 
CBDG is cut by more than $700 million. Under the current 
distribution formula, New York City will lose $58 million. I 
understand that HUD is proposing a new formula. Will this make 
up for the cuts, and when can we expect to see this proposal?
    Secretary Jackson. Let me say this to you. I just answered 
that to the Congresswoman from West Virginia. We have cities 
that are receiving large sums of monies, that I really don't 
think should be receiving those monies. I think we should 
concentrate the block grant program to those cities most in 
need where we have the highest rate of poverty, where we have 
the highest rate of the ability to make substantial changes in 
the quality of life for people. And in this case, we are trying 
to reallocate that based on where we see the greatest poverty 
need, not pockets of poverties in wealthy areas. That's a 
totally different situation.
    So if we--if the proposal is accepted by Congress and 
passed, then, yes, I think that clearly those areas where the 
greatest needs are will be addressed.",32
HR1892 hearing.txt," My 
bill allows any FHA-qualified borrower to participate in the new 
FHA low loan program. Second, the Frank-Waters bill authorizes 
the FHA to implement risk-based pricing but it leaves in place the 
current outdated premium caps of 2.25 percent up-front and 0.55 percent annually. And the zero and lower down payment loans  would have the higher caps. My concern is that these limits on premium caps will prevent FHA from serving riskier borrowers who  could be prudently served by charging a slightly higher premium.  With the flexibility to charge slightly higher premiums, FHA would  be able to serve borrowers with the lower FICO scores who are currently  being served only by the subprime market at very high interest  rates. With FHA mortgage insurance, lenders will charge 
borrowers the market mortgage interest rate. Without FHA insurance, 
they have no choice but to turn the borrower away or to 
charge for a risk in an increased mortgage interest rate. ",33

unfortunate result certainly does not seem equitable or 
appropriate, and furthermore, the designation of BAH as income

Federal income tax purposes.

Homeownership is not only the key to financial independence,

NHTF Hearing.txt," would like to end with a story that drives home why I think 
housing can be a medical intervention and can make kids better 
and keep them healthy. In my pediatric practice, I take care of a 
child, Whitney, whom I met when she was 9 months old. Her family 
was homeless at the time because they could not afford an 
apartment. 

At the time, she was falling off her growth chart. She already 
was having trouble growing. And over the next 3 months, she literally 
gained less than a pound. I needed to hospitalize her because 
she had become dangerously malnourished. 

She ended up needing to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 
because she had an underlying problem with swallowing, and 
she stayed there for over a month. You can imagine the cost of that 
to insurance. When she was at the rehabilitation hospital, she was 
able to gain weight, but as soon as she went back to the shelter, 
she began to lose weight again. 

After advocating with lawyers from our medico-legal partnership 
at Boston Medical Center, Whitney and her family were finally offered 
an affordable home at a local public housing development. 
Once in her new apartment and she was living there, she was able 
to gain weight, and within months her developmental delays improved 
and she was able to thrive. I recently saw Whitney at her 
physical a few months ago, and at 4 years old, she was starting to 
learn to read. 

I tried my best to treat Whitney. I gave her all my medical expertise, 
including very expensive medical care during hospitalizations. 
But the best medical intervention for her, the one that eventually 
made her well, was a safe, decent, affordable home.",32

In fact, Chairman Bernanke, in a speech last week, noted, ‘‘Contrary 
to what would be expected if the GSE portfolios lowered the 
funding cost of mortgages, over the past decade or so the spread 
between yields on 30-year fixed rate mortgages and treasuries of 
similar duration has tended to rise in periods in which the GSEs 
have increased the share of single family residential mortgage held 
in their portfolio, and to fall when the GSE share has fallen.’’ 

He went on to specifically state, ‘‘Due to the GSEs’ support for 
affordable housing,’’ and he answered his own question by saying, 
‘‘At the present time, Fannie and Freddie fail the test.’’ ",32

Mr. CISNEROS. There is very solid scientific evidence that shows 
that children in stable housing do better, not just in school but psychologically 
and in other ways. There is actual medical evidence 
that shows health conditions improve with the decency and stability 
and safety of housing. Overcrowding, substandard conditions, 
unsafe housing, lead paint problems, all of those impact children. 

I think it was Sheila’s group that just published or at least published 
another group’s report that said that actually, among minorities,

Number one, we have seen the largest mortgage markets in history

It is incredibly important that the GSEs maintain some flexibility

Those who do manage to purchase a home face additional struggles. 
Studies show that minorities are 30 percent more likely to receive 
a higher priced loan than white borrowers, even after accounting 
for risk. 

Of course, housing affordability is not just a problem for minorities. 
People of all backgrounds are finding it harder and harder 
than ever to pay for housing. 

According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard 
University, more than one in seven U.S. households spend more 
than half their income on housing. 

Finding affordable rental housing is another growing problem. In 
the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, two million affordable housing 
units were lost. HUD estimated in 2005 that they were only 77 
units affordable and available for every 100 low-income renters. 

That means nearly a quarter of low-income families do not have 
access to decent rental housing. Whether you look at the facts or 
consider personal experiences, the conclusion is the same. Affordable 
housing is no longer merely a problem, it is a crisis, and we 
must all do our part to address it. ",33
CHRG-107hhrg77785.htm,"A few years ago it seemed to me we were close to a 
consensus among policymakers that essentially all you needed to 
do was to remove the restrictions on capital and let capital 
find its most profitable niche anywhere in the world, and we 
would be, on the whole, better off. I think that that has been 
disproven by a good number of events. Clearly, the thrust of 
the New Deal was to say, yes, we want capital to be able to 
find its best area of return, but not without other factors 
being taken into account. Again, it's much harder to do that 
internationally.
    Argentina for a while was an example of the success of a 
fairly unrestrained capitalism. And what we have seen now is 
that in the global economy, that is not enough. And this is the 
point we have to make--no matter what people think about the 
appropriate public policy, there is a reaction now within 
Argentina politically to people have perceived to be that 
fairly unrestrained capitalist model that may be going further 
than is reasonable. Certainly, it's going further than is 
reasonable in many people's minds. And you see these 
connections. This Administration has made a free trade 
agreement for the Americas a high priority. That's endangered 
in part by the political reaction you are seeing in Argentina.
    So this, to me, is part of an ongoing effort to try to find 
a way to harmonize support for the capitalist system with 
attention to the kind of policy issues that Franklin Roosevelt 
successfully launched here in the United States. And unless we 
can come up with a better balance, I think we will continue to 
have these problems. I would just point out I was encouraged to 
see in the world economic forum in New York City, at least as 
it was reported to me--I wasn't there--the discussion was 
somewhat different and I would say more balanced than it had 
been before. There was more concern about the social aspect. 
And this is our challenge: How do you maintain globally a 
system in which capital is free to do its job of creating 
wealth, but not in a way that so exacerbates tensions and 
inequality either within countries or between countries where, 
ultimately, popular resistance will bring it down?",32

    And I thank, Mr. Frank, the chairman, for working with me. 
We've been trying for several years to raise, you know, limits 
in high-cost areas and introduce FHA in those high-cost areas. 
But on the jumbo market, 34.9 percent of the loans made in 2005 
were interest only, and 23.9 were negative ARMs. There's a

    Secretary Jackson. That's correct.
    Mr. Miller of California. And that's a problem we can do 
something about. We need to take and change the way the system 
has been going out there. We need to look at these high-cost 
areas and say how do we provide more opportunity for GSEs to 
compete in those areas and provide a good fixed-rate loan 
that's more affordable, more creative in some ways, and even an 
FHA to help people who don't have the down payment that they 
need to get into homes.
    What's your opinion on that? Where do think we've failed?
    Secretary Jackson. Well, first of all, let me say this, 
that you're correct. That's one of the reasons, I'll go back, 
that we need FHA modernization legislation, so we can address 
the needs of persons in California. In fact, Congressman, I'd 
say from Utah all the way back to California, from Virginia all 
the way back to the East Coast, we have the same problem. And

greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I

These men, women, children, and families have severe housing 
needs. In other words, they spend more than 50 percent of their income 
of housing and utilities.

In summary, half of all African Americans live in unaffordable, 
inadequate, and/or crowded housing. But of course, this is not only 
a problem for African Americans. Seventy-one percent of Hispanic 
Americans who fall into the extremely-low-income category have 
severe housing needs, and 66 percent of extremely-low-income Caucasians 
pay more than 50 percent of their income to ensure they 
have a roof over their heads. All these numbers add up to one 
alarming fact: Too many Americans of all races and ethnic backgrounds 
are too often forced to choose between shelter over their 
heads or food on their tables. 

If these numbers do not convince you of the clear need for a National 
Affordable Housing Trust Fund as established in this bill, let 
me also tell you that the situation is getting worse. In 2003, the 

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated 
that there was a deficit of two million extremely-low-income rental 
units. In 2005, that deficit had grown to four million. 
In 2003, HUD estimated that there were 44 affordable rental 
units available for every 100 extremely-low-income families. That 
number dropped to 40 units available in 2005, and the number continues 
to worsen. 

Unfortunately, the number of extremely-low-income households 
continues to grow as the number of affordable rental units decreases. 
As a matter of fact, of the 5.8 million black households reporting 
housing problems in 2003, 4.9 million cited housing afford-
ability as their biggest problem. ",33

NHTF Hearing.txt,"here are over 600 local or State housing trust 
funds today. In big cities, such as New York City, the effort is underway 
to try to create or preserve 4,300 units with a trust fund. 
In Chicago, the goal is 5,500 rental subsidized units, not over 30 
percent of median income, to meet the city-wide goal of producing 
affordable housing. 

In smaller communities, many that are in high-cost areas, such 
as Boulder, Colorado, the explicit goal of the City is to use a housing 
trust fund to make sure that 10 percent of the housing stock 
is permanently affordable. In Boulder, that amounts to 2,700 units 
of which 2,100 would be rental, and 600 would be ownership. 

In another high-cost area, Mountain View, California, they are 
using the housing trust fund of Santa Clara County there where 
Catholic Charities just produced an award winning single room occupancy 
facility for people earning between $15,000 and $30,000 a 
year. That is 20 percent of average median income, using the flexibility 
that only a housing trust fund makes possible.

million deal that required 14 separate sources of funds and had 
problems closing the last financial gap, delaying the project for 18 
months, which only drove up the costs more and created a cyclical 
problem. 

It is precisely the type of development that could have been funded 
through this Act, particularly given its targeting. 

If there were more Federal funds available, it would have meant 
a quicker development process and ultimately more public benefit. 

Our St. John of God & St. Jean Baptiste developments, also in 
Massachusetts, are very similar. They could have used this trust 
fund enormously. 

Finally, the Saint Aidan, which is a 59 unit mixed-income development 
located in Brookline, Massachusetts—in Brookline, by the 
way, the median family house price for a single family home last 
year was $1 million. With prices like that, what happens is that 
the teachers, firefighters, and librarians have to enter town in the 
morning and leave town at night; the people who serve you can no 
longer afford to live in the communities with you. 

Saint Aidan’s, though, will be 60 percent affordable, and in this 
case we are fortunate enough to have had Chairman Frank as our 
Representative, with the benefit of his leadership to solve a number 
of problems with the project and for that, we, and the Archdiocese, 
are enormously grateful.

us additional resources.

the great things about this Federal government has been its 
dedication to abolishing discrimination based on race, based on 
religion, based on gender, based on age, based on handicaps. 
There have been court opinions. There have been statutes. There 
have been regulations. There have been executive orders. The 
President's proposal appears to me to be a turning back of that 
clock. It sanctions discrimination. Indeed, we have previously 
held that while you might have a right to discriminate purely 
privately, the receipt of Federal funds gives you an even 
greater obligation not to discriminate. This proposal turns 
that on its head. People who receive Federal funds as we have 
interpreted this, and it has not been refuted, religious groups 
who receive Federal funds for secular purposes will be allowed 
to discriminate on religious grounds. That seems to me a 
terrible retreat from the principle of non-discrimination to 
which we have been committed.

I am also here today to share new evidence that shows that 
housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may

Public Health Commission, local community development corporations,

State or local governments to match the best local solution to the

Yet when you have communities that would accept them, there is 
generally no vacant land. We passed a bill out of this

take these polluted sites, to clean them up and we can build 
affordable housing within communities who want them and need 
them. But it appears to be a circle conversation here that we

By virtue of the fact of their structure, they have been barred

that the legislation really doesn’t go far enough in reigning them

NHTF Hearing.txt,"I would like to end with a story that drives home why I think 
housing can be a medical intervention and can make kids better 
and keep them healthy. In my pediatric practice, I take care of a 
child, Whitney, whom I met when she was 9 months old. Her family 
was homeless at the time because they could not afford an 
apartment. 

At the time, she was falling off her growth chart. She already 
was having trouble growing. And over the next 3 months, she literally 
gained less than a pound. I needed to hospitalize her because 
she had become dangerously malnourished. 

She ended up needing to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 
because she had an underlying problem with swallowing, and 
she stayed there for over a month. You can imagine the cost of that 
to insurance. When she was at the rehabilitation hospital, she was 
able to gain weight, but as soon as she went back to the shelter, 
she began to lose weight again. 

After advocating with lawyers from our medico-legal partnership 
at Boston Medical Center, Whitney and her family were finally offered 
an affordable home at a local public housing development. 
Once in her new apartment and she was living there, she was able 
to gain weight, and within months her developmental delays improved 
and she was able to thrive. I recently saw Whitney at her 
physical a few months ago, and at 4 years old, she was starting to 
learn to read. 

I tried my best to treat Whitney. I gave her all my medical expertise, 
including very expensive medical care during hospitalizations. 
But the best medical intervention for her, the one that eventually 
made her well, was a safe, decent, affordable home. ",32

HR1892 hearing.txt,"In addition to affordable loans, Latino families benefit from 
homeownership counseling. NCLR created a network of housing 
counselors 10 years ago. Now we are serving more than 33 Latino 
communities across the country. Last year, we helped nearly 3,000 
families purchase their first home. Participants cite counseling as 
one of the most important factors in their ability to successfully 
purchase. Research also shows that these families are far less likely 
to default. H.R. 1852 increases the availability of counseling for 
FHA borrowers. This is especially important for borrowers who 
would access the newer products such as zero down payment and 
interest-only loans. 

Last year, we also helped over 1,000 families who were already 
homeowners. Some were falling behind on their loan payments; 
others needed help to be refinanced in a more affordable mortgage. 
For many families in danger of default, time is the enemy. The earlier 
we can talk with the borrowers regarding their late payments, 
the better. Counselors are working hard to get the word out for 
their services but this is not enough. Counselors need more resources 
and they need to get to the borrower before it is too late. 
Congresswoman Waters and Congresswoman Velazquez worked on 
this issue. The opt-in provision of H.R. 1852 will allow families access 
to foreclosure prevention assistance. FHA borrowers will be 
able to sign a form saying they want a counseling agency to contact 
them in the case of default. We believe this is a powerful tool that 
will connect families with intervention services when they need it. 

One successful example of foreclosure assistance is Ms. Vega. 
She came to visit the Spanish Coalition for Housing in Chicago a 
couple of months ago. Her mortgage payments jumped unexpectedly 
and she could not make them. The initial repayment plan offered 
by her servicer was too expensive. Our counselors were able 
to negotiate on her behalf and because of their work, the terms of 
Ms. Vega’s loan have been modified. If it weren’t for the Coalition’s

from 3 percent to 2.25 percent and the maximum annual fee from 

2.2 percent to .55 percent. These reductions will reduce FHA closing 
cost premiums for a hypothetical family buying a $300,000 
home by $2,250 in annual fees over a 5-year period of $20,000 compared 
to last year’s bill. 
The bill also adds a number of home buyer protections not included 
in last year’s bill for families taking out riskier zero-down 
payment loans and for borrowers who represent a higher credit 
risk. The bill gives HUD the authority to require pre-purchase 
counseling for riskier borrowers, requires a number of disclosures 
spelling out the costs and risk of zero down and lower down payment 
loans, and provides the borrower opt-in to receive notice of 
availability of counseling in the event a borrower falls behind in 
their loan payments. FHA has very strong loss mitigation measures 
in place so the borrower protections in the bill are a plus that 
are widely supported. ",33

the Home Investment Partnership Program. 

The latest Federal Block Grant for States—I mean, I’m sorry, the 
largest Federal Block Grant for State and local government, HOME 
is designed to create affordable housing for low-income households. 
It is a successful program. It has a proven track record. 

Establishing another, a new housing trust fund, separate and 
apart from HOME and promulgating new regulations and rules at 
HUD could take months or years to properly implement. HOME is 
already up and running with 50 States, 585 local governments, and 
four insular areas presently administering the existing successful 
program. 

Rather than reinventing the wheel, I believe a better approach 
would be to take this opportunity to make an already successful 
Federal program work better by using HOME to increase production

to very-low and extremely-low-income families. ",33

CHRG-108hhrg93838.htm,"One year ago Freddie Mac first revealed that it would delay 
the release of the 2002 accounting reports pending the 
completion of a restatement of its financial records for 
earlier years. This announcement raised considerable concerns 
for those who monitor GSEs. It also began a period of intense 
scrutiny of the company by its regulators, lawmakers and the 
press.
    Six months later, Freddie Mac's Board announced an 
unexpected management shakeup. This change in corporate 
leadership produced even greater concerns among those with 
knowledge of GSEs. For example, I observed that government-
sponsored enterprises with public responsibilities and private 
capital have a special obligation to operate fairly, safely, 
and soundly. I believe and I continue to believe that today. 
The management of these entities must ensure that they produce 
accounting statements that reflect their real financial 
conditions.
    At the time I also said that Freddie Mac must maintain 
sufficient capital reserves, adopt prudent management reforms, 
expedite completion of its earnings restatements, and employ 
appropriate accounting techniques to prevent similar problems 
in the future. I suspect that, before we complete today's 
hearing, we will discuss each of these issues in great depth. 
We have a responsibility to study these matters and ensure that 
the company follows its statutory mandate to operate in a safe 
and sound manner.
    Additionally, the financial reporting problems by Freddie 
Mac renewed efforts by some to modify GSE regulation. As I said 
at our very first hearing on oversight of government-sponsored 
enterprises in March of 2000, we need to have strong 
independent regulators that have the resources they need to get 
the job done. I continue to support strong GSE regulation. A 
strong regulator will protect the continued validity of our 
capital markets and promote confidence in Freddie Mac and 
Fannie Mae. It will also ensure taxpayers against systemic risk 
and expand opportunities for all Americans.
    Today more than 68 percent of Americans own the homes in 
which they live. Government-sponsored enterprises have 
contributed greatly to this accomplishment. Because our housing 
marketplace is one of the most important sectors in our 
persistently struggling economy, we must also tread carefully

NHTF Hearing.txt,"Somehow it is no longer a case of Fannie and Freddie getting too 
much from these advantages, but us preying on these poor, 
unsuspecting private corporations. They are not wholly private corporations. 
They are quasi-public entities and we think that the alternative 
of reducing the advantages they get and diminishing the 
amount of money that’s available for housing is not a good one. The 
other choice, of course, is to leave the status quo in which they get 
more benefit than they should and that they pay back. 

And we’ve taken what we think is the middle course. We leave 
the benefits, although with greatly increased regulation, but we use 
some of that money for good public purpose. Similarly with the 
FHA, our bill, contrary to suggestions that it’s going to lead to FHA 
fee increases, in the bill that our committee passed we seek to prevent 
the Bush Administration from increasing FHA fees not because 
there is a need to do that to do FHA business but to help 
benefit the general Treasury. 

And section 30 of the bill would prohibit HUD from increasing 
any FHA premium above the level that was in effect at the beginning 
of this fiscal year unless the Secretary shows that in the absence 
of an increase the program would require a subsidy from the 
Congress. So we, in fact, strengthen the resistance to FHA fee increases, 
and that applies to what we’re doing here. 

If anything in this legislation that we have passed on the FHA 
that would get incorporated here were to cause a fee increase that 
would kick in. So we in fact prohibit fee increases. In fact our bill 
says no money goes to the housing fund if it were threatened, a fee 
increase. So the truth is that the bill that we passed already on the 
FHA, and it’s all part of one package conceptually, prevents a fee 
increase that is being contemplated.

And I will say, and I don’t ask for any comment on this, that my 
sense is that the desire for this fee increase did not come from the 
FHA and that it did not come from HUD, but it came from OMB.

I think the key to eliminating the concentrations of poverty that

that also have the first-time home buyers and the market

Although I do not question people’s motives and I believe their 
hearts and motives are pure, many on this committee with their 
votes have made housing less affordable. If we truly want to make 
housing more affordable, we need to realize there is no greater 
housing program in American than a good job. And since we have 
enacted pro-growth tax policies in 2003, we have had 8.2 million 
new jobs created. And yet many in this House and many on the 
committee want the tax relief to go away. And, as you take away 
the tax relief, you begin to take away the jobs. 

Secondly, if we truly care about affordable housing, we need to 
realize how the single largest tax increase in American history contained 
within the Democrat budget resolution, how that impacts 
families who are trying to make their homes affordable. 

I hear from constituents in my district. I hear from the Brucker 
Family in Wills Point who writes, ‘‘No increase in taxes. My family 
is only one breath away from losing our home as it is.’’ 

I hear from the Stevens Family in Forney, Texas, ‘‘If our taxes 
increased $2,755, we would not be able to pay our mortgage.’’ And 
the list goes on and on and on. We need to realize that more spending 
fuels more taxes which makes homes less affordable. 

Third, it seems ironic to me that we would increase taxes on 
some, make housing less affordable for many low- and middle-income 
Americans because we know that Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac are an effectively a government protected duopoly. They have 
great economic power to simply pass along these fees or taxes, if

low-income families must pay more than half of their income for 
housing. 

All of these offer substantial proof of the need for a national 
housing trust fund. This is about hope and prosperity for all. This 
is the American dream. 

As you know, Mr. Chairman, many localities have created their 
own housing trust fund. There is a great deal of experience across 
the Nation in cities and counties, as expressed by Secretary 
Cisneros. ",33
CHRG-108hhrg88663.htm,"Then, we heard from witnesses on some of the known 
unknowns, the concerns for which there are no answers. Will 
HANF reduce the number of families currently receiving 
benefits, due to the eroding value of block grants? Will it 
eliminate the flexibility of vouchers? Today, I am interested 
in hearing about two more of these known unknowns. First, will 
block granting dampen landlord participation in the program? 
Currently, HANF includes no assurance of continued funding of 
existing vouchers from year to year. It also gives States the 
authority to cut the subsidy level of vouchers and place 
lifetime limits on benefits, leaving Section 8 families with 
nowhere to live. Wouldn't this force landlords to undergo 
lengthy and expensive legal eviction processes for each of 
their tenants, and thereby discourage their participation in 
the program?",32

Rental Housing Support Program provides rent subsidies for an estimated 
4,000 rent burdened households.

they allow funds to be tailored to localized housing and community

can reduce refinancing and perhaps some defaults and foreclosures 
as well. In contrast, the Franks-Waters bill requires the refund of 
excess up-front premiums charged to higher risk borrowers, those 
with FICO scores below 560. I am concerned that this provision 
could have unintended consequences of limiting the number of borrowers 
that could be served by the FHA program because it may 
require initial premiums to be even higher. The refund provision 
would also be very difficult to implement. It is inevitable in an insurance 
fund that lower risk borrowers will subsidize higher risk 
borrowers. Refunds of this nature undercut the concept of insurance 
and is the logical equivalent of a healthy person requiring a 
100 percent refund of his or her health insurance premiums or a

that we are supporting says that if you or someone with higher

pays it back, you should not, in the end, be charged more 
by your own Federal Government than someone making 3 times as 
much money as you. That is the radical proposition which we are 
advocating. We recognize there is a risk, and we said, okay, there 
will be some higher up-front premiums. But we say that if you 
meet your obligations, if you work very hard and pay back what 
you owe, why should you pay more than somebody who makes far 
more money than you because other people in your situation previously 
defaulted? 

Now the gentlewoman said, ‘‘Well, that rule was strict, what is 
available?’’ No, only if you consider the higher credit risk people to 
be a closed pot. I, along with the gentlewoman from California, 
have been preaching, and I think finally we are going to win and 
we are going to admit California, Massachusetts, and New York to 
the Union. We are going to allow them to fully participate in Federal 
housing programs: FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. They 
have been somewhat excluded for some time. That will generate 
some revenues, and we intend to take some of the additional revenues 
generated within this set of programs and use them to make 
the radical proposition—that if you are of a higher credit risk and 
you borrow money and you get your mortgage insurance from the 
FHA and you pay back every penny you were supposed to, that you 
will not be charged more by your own Federal Government—true. 
That is the best thing we can do about the subprime market. 

And there was also a comparison to insurance. Well, this is the 
Federal Government. I do not think that the Federal Government 
ought to—I know there is a dispute about whether or not we 
should help the poor at the expense of the wealthy but is there 
really an argument that we should penalize lower income people by 
charging them more for exactly the same mortgage insurance as 
someone who makes 3 times as much because somebody else who 
makes the same amount they do did not pay it back? So, yes, that 
is what we are saying. We are saying that if the FHA is to generate 
surpluses, as it has for 12 years, rather than that money 
going for earmarks in the agricultural surpluses and wars and 
trips and other things, it should be recycled to some extent for affordable 
housing, which does help everybody as you add to housing. 
One of the problems we have had is a housing program whereby 
we have only done vouchers so we have added to the demand for
