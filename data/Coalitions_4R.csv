NHTF Hearing.txt," am also here today to share new evidence that shows that 
housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may

frequently move. We know children who stay in the same home 
and do not more frequently have better child development outcomes 
and do better in school. ",20
HR1892 hearing.txt," And I am going to be working on an amendment 
that would be part of FHA, expanding it in a certain framework, 
so that daycare loans and financing could be there in a flexible 
way not only for new construction but for homes that are going 
to have licensed daycare in it.",21
NHTF Hearing.txt," And since we have 
enacted pro-growth tax policies in 2003, we have had 8.2 million 
new jobs created. And yet many in this House and many on the 
committee want the tax relief to go away. And, as you take away 
the tax relief, you begin to take away the jobs. 

Secondly, if we truly care about affordable housing, we need to 
realize how the single largest tax increase in American history contained 
within the Democrat budget resolution, how that impacts 
families who are trying to make their homes affordable. 

I hear from constituents in my district. I hear from the Brucker 
Family in Wills Point who writes, ‘‘No increase in taxes. My family 
is only one breath away from losing our home as it is.’’ 

I hear from the Stevens Family in Forney, Texas, ‘‘If our taxes 
increased $2,755, we would not be able to pay our mortgage.’’ And 
the list goes on and on and on. We need to realize that more spending 
fuels more taxes which makes homes less affordable. 

Third, it seems ironic to me that we would increase taxes on 
some, make housing less affordable for many low- and middle-income 
Americans because we know that Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac are an effectively a government protected duopoly. They have 
great economic power to simply pass along these fees or taxes, if 
you will, ultimately to the consumer. And so this is a mortgage tax, 
pure and simple. ",21

NHTF Hearing.txt," As I have expressed since its inception, this fund 
is straight out of Central Planning 101. This is really a step in the 
wrong direction. 

There appears here to be a clear conflict of vision. I think past 
government housing programs have actually done very little, if you 
look at the record, to increase homeownership levels in this country. 
We do not have much to show for the tens of billions of dollars 
we spent on housing through HUD and FHA, but there is a way 
to improve homeownership rates. 

They improve when real interest rates are low and when consumer 
incomes are high. Under that kind of an environment people 
can afford to frankly get into a position where they can buy their 
own home. I believe limited government and free market policies 
will generate these results; creeping socialism will not. It will work 
more as an anchor on the economy and prosperity. It will keep the 
private sector from becoming as vibrant and creating the opportunities 
for people so that they can move up. 

This fund will waste resources. It’s going to provide false hope 
for those who wish to increase homeownership. Additionally this 
fund will create a terrible precedent, a terrible, terrible precedent 
for other industries in this country. As I said during the GSE and

To address their needs, to produce housing that touches the entire 
first part of this continuum, from homelessness through these 
various first steps, we need units, production, and housing stock, 
that low-income people can access. 

We need units so that homeless people can access the Housing 
First concept. We have to have housing units for them to be able 
to move out of homelessness. 

We need supportive housing with services. We need low-income 
rental stock. I am in the home ownership business personally, but 
I acknowledge the absolute most pressing need before the country 
in housing is the lowest income rental stock. 

We need housing that works with other programs, such as public 
housing, and we need housing that works in conjunction with market

ago a consensus that said in addition to a capitalist system, 
you needed to make that work by a very minimalist public sector 
approach. And that I think has been called into question by 
events. When Franklin Roosevelt became President, he made the 
decision to try to preserve the capitalist system. There were 
some hems and haws in how he ultimately decided to do that. But 
the notion was that we would have the capitalist system plus a 
Government role involving some regulation and some intervention

work, if you do not have people unequally rewarded according to 
how hard they work, how smart they invest, how cunningly they 
anticipate public needs, and so forth? Then you don't get the

flexibility. From my experience working in Boston with the Boston 
Public Health Commission, local community development corporations, 
and some State-funded housing developments, the ability for 
State or local governments to match the best local solution to the 
greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I 
urge you to support H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing 
Trust Fund bill, because it can ensure that our most vulnerable 
population, our children, have safe, decent, and affordable homes. ",20

that one of the most important things that this Congress can do as 
we search for ways to help those who have been harmed by the 
subprime market is to give FHA the tools it needs to be a viable 
alternative for first time and lower income borrowers. That is why 
this hearing on FHA modernization is both timely and critical. By 
modernizing FHA we can provide another alternative for low-income 
borrowers who may otherwise be forced into higher cost 
subprime loans or even predatory products. By moving quickly to 
modernize FHA, we can provide a safe alternative for hundreds of 
thousands of lower income credit-worthy borrowers looking to either 
purchase a new home or avoid foreclosure. ",21

amount, but in some of these areas where we are talking about instead 
of as some might transfer assets, we all know how this is 
done, you can transfer assets and make your audit look really good, 
assets disappear, in the construction industry, we have been required 
for years to put up surety bonds and it has worked very, 
very well. And if it is a cash audit or it is a surety bond for the

HR1892 hearing.txt," I work with 
my friend from Texas on a lot of issues, and there are a lot of areas 
where this committee can cooperate across party lines, but nowhere 
have the differences that do exist between the parties been made 
more clear than in his last statement when he described the effort 
by the gentlewoman from California and myself to provide more 
funding for affordable housing as ‘‘extortion.’’ The FHA is a Federal 
agency created by Federal law. And the notion that it is ‘‘extortion’’ 
to try to use some of the surplus funds it has been generating to 
help provide affordable housing greatly defines the difference between 
the parties. 

I noticed that the gentlewoman from Illinois—who temporarily 
had to leave and who has been a very constructive member also— 
said, ‘‘Well, we should not be using FHA funds for other purposes.’’ 
Maybe she missed this, but during the entire period of Republican 
majority rule, that is exactly what was happening. The FHA was 
producing surpluses which went into the general treasury, and 
they have been used to support such non-housing related issues as 
the war in Iraq, nuclear testing, or anything else the Federal Government 
does. This notion that money should not come from the 
FHA for other purposes is a very new one because the FHA has 
been a money maker for the rest of the Federal Government in the 
past. Now it is true that many of us—including the gentlewoman 
from California and I—believe that if the FHA continues to generate 
surpluses, and we certainly will guarantee that first claim on 
any monies goes to keep the FHA functioning, but the question is 
should the surpluses go into the general treasury and help offset 
everything else the Federal Government does, such as farm subsidies, 
the war in Iraq, bridges to nowhere, and all of those other 
purposes for which it was put, or should we target it towards affordable 
housing? ",20

HR1892 hearing.txt," In 2006—is that better—1.2 million families entered 
into foreclosure, 42 percent more than in 2005. Predatory 
lending, exotic mortgages, and a dramatic rise in subprime lend-
ing,coupled with slowing home price appreciation have all contributed 
to this crisis. When the Federal Housing Administration was 
established back in 1934, consumers faced a similar lending crisis. 
At that time, FHA was an innovator and led the private market 
in offering safe, affordable home loans to American families. Since 
its inception, FHA has insured more than 34 million properties. 
However, the FHA has failed to keep pace with borrower needs and 
changes in the private market and is no longer a viable alternative 
for many borrowers. At the same time, the subprime and non-traditional 
mortgage markets have boomed. Many of these loans offer 
low teaser rates which reset to much higher rates after a few years. 
In many cases, these borrowers qualified only on their ability to 
make the initial payment and face large prepayment penalties if 
they attempt to refinance. Mortgage experts estimate that approximately 
$1.5 trillion worth of adjustable mortgages will reset by the 
end of 2007. Faced with significantly higher monthly payments, 
many borrowers will face the possibility of losing their homes. ",20

The Federal Government runs, I believe, over 80 different housing 
and community development programs through HUD, as our 
ranking member said, over 30 specifically geared towards affordable 
housing programs. 

And so today our committee response is not necessarily to improve 
or reform the old programs but instead to create a new program

precipitously. Lenders have progressed, reacting to quickly changing

concentrate the block grant program to those cities most in

the highest rate of the ability to make substantial changes in 
the quality of life for people. And in this case, we are trying 
to reallocate that based on where we see the greatest poverty 
need, not pockets of poverties in wealthy areas. That's a 
totally different situation.

based on the number of applications that have been filed, over 
109,000 and the very few--when we were there about 775 had been 
completed. I'm told they've added some to that.
    Secretary Jackson. Right.
    Ms. Waters. But it seems to me that if there is some way 
that you could use that information to determine that they have 
not followed their plan because they are not producing in a way 
that is very helpful, they're not expediting, please take a 
look at that.
    And two other things I don't know whether you can look at, 
but we--I discovered that they didn't know how to do 
appraisals, I don't think. They basically started out doing 
appraisals not based on the value of the house that was there 
prior to Katrina, but post-Katrina, after the houses had been 
turned over, blown over. So is there some way you could look at 
that?
    And also, clearing titles. They certainly don't know how to 
clear a title, and I know that there are some complications 
there because houses have been passed down not in a legal way. 
You know, through the years, the families have done this. But 
you can't hold up replacing those homes and getting homeowners 
back if they can't clear titles. So I wish that you and 
whatever experts you may have at your disposal would take a 
look at appraisals and clearing titles and see if you can find 
a way to use whatever leverage you might have to help them 
expedite this program.",20

bill allows any FHA-qualified borrower to participate in the new 
FHA low loan program. Second, the Frank-Waters bill authorizes 
the FHA to implement risk-based pricing but it leaves in place the 
current outdated premium caps of 2.25 percent up-front and 0.55 percent annually. And the zero and lower down payment loans  would have the higher caps. My concern is that these limits on premium caps will prevent FHA from serving riskier borrowers who  could be prudently served by charging a slightly higher premium.  With the flexibility to charge slightly higher premiums, FHA would  be able to serve borrowers with the lower FICO scores who are currently  being served only by the subprime market at very high interest  rates. With FHA mortgage insurance, lenders will charge 
borrowers the market mortgage interest rate. Without FHA insurance,

was homeless at the time because they could not afford an 
apartment. 

At the time, she was falling off her growth chart. She already 
was having trouble growing. And over the next 3 months, she literally 
gained less than a pound. I needed to hospitalize her because 
she had become dangerously malnourished. 

She ended up needing to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 
because she had an underlying problem with swallowing, and 
she stayed there for over a month. You can imagine the cost of that 
to insurance. When she was at the rehabilitation hospital, she was 
able to gain weight, but as soon as she went back to the shelter, 
she began to lose weight again.

at Boston Medical Center, Whitney and her family were finally offered 
an affordable home at a local public housing development.

to gain weight, and within months her developmental delays improved 
and she was able to thrive. I recently saw Whitney at her 
physical a few months ago, and at 4 years old, she was starting to 
learn to read.

I share Mr. Baker’s concerns, as he has expressed over the years, 
with the performance of the GSEs and their finances and their

when we passed the legislation out of this committee, with regard 
to the housing fund, and how that would have a negative impact 
upon the housing marketplace. And in light of the subprime market’s 
concerns, I am wondering how that will all flesh out, as well, 
whether what we may be doing here today is exacerbating that 
problem. 

As we only saw this bill drop in—as Mr. Renzi indicated—on Friday, 
I am still in the process of reviewing it, as well. I am pleased

I think the key to eliminating the concentrations of poverty that 
you see, and creating a vibrant community, is to be able to take 
the funds that are targeted at those very-low-income households 
making 30 percent of median or less, and use those in developments 
that also have the first-time home buyers and the market 
rate condominiums, and use the pieces of the tool that are allowed, 
given its flexibility in the Trust Fund Act, for the moderate-income 
component as well—the downpayment assistance, construction 
costs. 

I mean, it is all the same development, and you can use that 
money for construction costs, for acquisition, for downpayment assistance, 
and for closing cost assistance. So I think there is a lot 
of attention still in the bill to helping that moderate-income group, 
but it does it in a way that you can integrate it with the very-lowincome 
as well. ",20

Those who do manage to purchase a home face additional struggles.

Finding affordable rental housing is another growing problem. In 
the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, two million affordable housing 
units were lost. HUD estimated in 2005 that they were only 77 
units affordable and available for every 100 low-income renters.

that have been returned to a State entity. That’s a big jump from 
now taking on a Federal level, the possibility of taking funds out 
of a housing agency to go fund a housing trust fund.

and the partnership between private enterprise and government. ",20
CHRG-107hhrg77785.htm,"A few years ago it seemed to me we were close to a 
consensus among policymakers that essentially all you needed to 
do was to remove the restrictions on capital and let capital 
find its most profitable niche anywhere in the world, and we 
would be, on the whole, better off. I think that that has been 
disproven by a good number of events. Clearly, the thrust of 
the New Deal was to say, yes, we want capital to be able to 
find its best area of return, but not without other factors 
being taken into account. Again, it's much harder to do that 
internationally.
    Argentina for a while was an example of the success of a 
fairly unrestrained capitalism. And what we have seen now is 
that in the global economy, that is not enough. And this is the 
point we have to make--no matter what people think about the 
appropriate public policy, there is a reaction now within 
Argentina politically to people have perceived to be that 
fairly unrestrained capitalist model that may be going further 
than is reasonable. Certainly, it's going further than is 
reasonable in many people's minds. And you see these 
connections. This Administration has made a free trade 
agreement for the Americas a high priority. That's endangered 
in part by the political reaction you are seeing in Argentina.
    So this, to me, is part of an ongoing effort to try to find 
a way to harmonize support for the capitalist system with 
attention to the kind of policy issues that Franklin Roosevelt 
successfully launched here in the United States. And unless we 
can come up with a better balance, I think we will continue to 
have these problems. I would just point out I was encouraged to 
see in the world economic forum in New York City, at least as 
it was reported to me--I wasn't there--the discussion was 
somewhat different and I would say more balanced than it had 
been before. There was more concern about the social aspect. 
And this is our challenge: How do you maintain globally a 
system in which capital is free to do its job of creating 
wealth, but not in a way that so exacerbates tensions and 
inequality either within countries or between countries where, 
ultimately, popular resistance will bring it down?",20

of how do you promote policies in the world that increase 
prosperity without so exacerbating inequality that social

    We've got a worldwide consensus that capitalism is without 
question the best way to generate wealth. There was a few years 
ago a consensus that said in addition to a capitalist system, 
you needed to make that work by a very minimalist public sector 
approach. And that I think has been called into question by 
events. When Franklin Roosevelt became President, he made the 
decision to try to preserve the capitalist system. There were 
some hems and haws in how he ultimately decided to do that. But 
the notion was that we would have the capitalist system plus a 
Government role involving some regulation and some intervention 
to provide social equity.
    Our challenge today is to try and duplicate that kind of 
approach on the global scale. Now it's extremely harder. You're 
not dealing with one sovereignty. But it's the same kind of 
intellectual problem. How do you give full rein to the 
capitalist system, which after all depends on inequality to 
work, if you do not have people unequally rewarded according to 
how hard they work, how smart they invest, how cunningly they 
anticipate public needs, and so forth? Then you don't get the 
wealth creation. What I believe and many others, and I think 
this was what Franklin Roosevelt argued, there is a point 
beyond which the inequality can become dysfunctional. That it 
can be more than is necessary to give the proper incentives. 
There is also a need for some forms of regulation.",20

to me human nature that the decision on the loan is not going 
to be made purely on the loan.
    And I understand that these are against the law--let me go 
back to the limitation of statutes--but it is not prudent to 
give regulators very hard things to enforce. And I think that 
the practicality of enforcing the anti-tying rules is greatly 
multiplied when you allow sellers of products unrelated to the 
financial institution to be in a position where the bank that 
they own can benefit in two ways, one from the loan, and one 
from the sale of the product.

NHTF Hearing.txt,"And we’ve taken what we think is the middle course. We leave 
the benefits, although with greatly increased regulation, but we use 
some of that money for good public purpose. Similarly with the 
FHA, our bill, contrary to suggestions that it’s going to lead to FHA 
fee increases, in the bill that our committee passed we seek to prevent 
the Bush Administration from increasing FHA fees not because 
there is a need to do that to do FHA business but to help 
benefit the general Treasury. 

And section 30 of the bill would prohibit HUD from increasing 
any FHA premium above the level that was in effect at the beginning 
of this fiscal year unless the Secretary shows that in the absence 
of an increase the program would require a subsidy from the 
Congress. So we, in fact, strengthen the resistance to FHA fee increases, 
and that applies to what we’re doing here. 

If anything in this legislation that we have passed on the FHA 
that would get incorporated here were to cause a fee increase that 
would kick in. So we in fact prohibit fee increases. In fact our bill 
says no money goes to the housing fund if it were threatened, a fee 
increase. So the truth is that the bill that we passed already on the 
FHA, and it’s all part of one package conceptually, prevents a fee 
increase that is being contemplated. 


3 


And I will say, and I don’t ask for any comment on this, that my 
sense is that the desire for this fee increase did not come from the 
FHA and that it did not come from HUD, but it came from OMB. 
That is to be the FHA’s contribution to the war in Iraq. And we 
make it very clear that the FHA fee should increase only if there 
was a need to do that for FHA business. ",20

me. 

I totally agree with that concept, except that the peculiarity of 
these organizations, having an outside mission created by the Congress, 
I feel that there is less likelihood of an incestuous relationship 
existing if the outside appointees are made, in fact, by the normal 
members of the regulatory board. They have interests slightly 
different, in terms of mission, and whether or not, over a period of 
time, particularly the Federal Home Loan Bank system could be 
lost in its mission without any way of the Congress or anyone else 
correcting the mission, or bringing about or even finding out that 
the change of the mission has occurred. ",20
NHTF Hearing.txt,"Another aspect of the bill that I think is excellent is the local 
flexibility. From my experience working in Boston with the Boston 
Public Health Commission, local community development corporations, 
and some State-funded housing developments, the ability for 
State or local governments to match the best local solution to the 
greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I 
urge you to support H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing 
Trust Fund bill, because it can ensure that our most vulnerable 
population, our children, have safe, decent, and affordable homes. ",20
CHRG-108hhrg8920.htm,"Another question has come up with regard specifically to 
the HUD rule, and that is the feasibility and advisability and 
maybe constitutionality of the commingling of funds, and that 
is one the things that I want to address here.
    We are told that this program, as the President has 
announced it, assumes that people could get money and build a 
building that would be partly for religious purposes and partly 
for nonreligious purposes; and the amount that the building can 
be used in one way or the other would depend on the amount of 
money being put in.
    Now, one question I have is, is that physical or temporal? 
That is, since some religious institutions only have worship 1 
day a week, maybe 2 or 3 days a week, does that mean that you 
could take a building and build it, and if you prayed in it 1 
day a week, then you could use the whole building 6 days a week 
for other purposes? Or is it a physical separation?
    Another question is, how do we enforce some of these rules 
with regard to Community Development Block Grant entitlement 
communities? Frankly, some people have said that the Federal 
Government will be careful with the religious groups that it 
deals with, and that it won't deal with groups that might be 
problematic. But under the Community Development Block Grant I 
assume I understand correctly that an entitlement city under 
this rule could take the money and give it to any religious 
institution it wanted to. Does that mean that the Church of 
Scientology, the Nation of Islam and others would be eligible 
for the money and could then hire only its own members?
    Finally, I was pleased to see Secretary Martinez say at a 
recent hearing here, actually, on the down payment assistance 
program, that he did not think that we were abridging anybody's 
civil rights. Well, I have some questions about that. We have 
an Executive Order, 11246, that goes back to Franklin Roosevelt 
and A. Philip Randolph that has been interpreted by people as 
applying to the Community Development Block Grant program, and 
the Executive Order here says it no longer does.
    We also have this question: There is language in here that 
says the recipients will be independent from State and local 
governments. Does this purport to preempt or to say that State 
and local laws, we don't abide by them?
    And then we have this issue: Congress could, by statute, 
preempt State and local laws. But is the Administration 
contending that the Executive Order--that the President, by 
himself, can affect the binding nature of State and local laws?
    If we have State and local laws through which a grantee 
would ordinarily be subject, is it the position of the 
Administration that this Executive Order diminishes the force 
of those State and local laws? Because I think we run then into 
serious constitutional issues.",20

difficult for many Americans, and is proving to be especially 
hard for extremely-low-income Americans. Unfortunately, a 
disproportionate number of these people are African Americans and 
other racial and ethnic minorities. 

Currently only 46 percent of African Americans own their own 
homes, compared to more than 70 percent of white Americans. Perhaps 
more troubling than that statistic, however, is the disparate 
number of African Americans who spend too much of their income, 
which is already at the low end of the wage scale, on housing and 
utilities. 

The most current numbers we have indicate that 23 percent of 
African Americans fall into the extremely-low-income category. 
These men, women, children, and families have severe housing 
needs. In other words, they spend more than 50 percent of their income 
of housing and utilities.

In summary, half of all African Americans live in unaffordable, 
inadequate, and/or crowded housing. But of course, this is not only 
a problem for African Americans. Seventy-one percent of Hispanic 
Americans who fall into the extremely-low-income category have 
severe housing needs, and 66 percent of extremely-low-income Caucasians 
pay more than 50 percent of their income to ensure they 
have a roof over their heads. All these numbers add up to one 
alarming fact: Too many Americans of all races and ethnic backgrounds 
are too often forced to choose between shelter over their 
heads or food on their tables. 

If these numbers do not convince you of the clear need for a National 
Affordable Housing Trust Fund as established in this bill, let 
me also tell you that the situation is getting worse. In 2003, the 

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated 
that there was a deficit of two million extremely-low-income rental 
units. In 2005, that deficit had grown to four million. 
In 2003, HUD estimated that there were 44 affordable rental 
units available for every 100 extremely-low-income families. That 
number dropped to 40 units available in 2005, and the number continues 
to worsen. 

Unfortunately, the number of extremely-low-income households 
continues to grow as the number of affordable rental units decreases.

GSE hearing.txt,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are our partners in the real estate 
industry, so keeping them strong and sound is in everyone’s interest. 
With that in mind, Realtors have six recommendations that we 
believe should be considered in any legislative proposals to reform 
GSE oversight. 

First, the GSEs need a strong regulator and sound corporate governance. 
Regulatory oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 
Federal Home Loan Bank should be transferred to a new regulator 


8 


which has the authority to set capital standards, liquidate a financially 
unstable enterprise, and approve new programs and products. 
The regulators should also understand and support the GSEs’ 
vital housing finance mission and the role housing plays in supporting 
our national economy. 

Realtors also support legislative efforts to strengthen the governance 
of the Federal Home Loan Banks, by raising the number of 
independent directors, adding community and economic development 
expertise, and allowing appointed independent directors to 
continue their service until a successor is in place. 

Second, the GSEs’ vital housing mission should be preserved and 
protected. This mission ensures that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
provide capital to the market during downturns, and use their Federal 
ties to facilitate mortgage finance, and support homeownership 
opportunities. The GSEs’ housing mission is vital to the continued 
success of the housing market. Realtors will oppose legislative proposals 
which diminish that. 

Third, the GSEs must be able to develop new products and programs 
that respond to market needs. The standards for approving 
new products and programs should be those contained in the Federal 
National Mortgage Association Charter Act, and the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act. We support requiring the 
GSEs to provide notice to the regulator, so that adequate safety, 
soundness, and mission review can be accomplished. 

We oppose requirements that could unduly delay or prevent the 
GSEs from developing new programs and products that support 
their missions. 

Fourth, there should be no overly restrictive bright line test that 
explicitly limits the GSEs’ role in the secondary market, strictly defined. 
Realtors believe such a test would seriously hinder important 
mission-related consumer outreach activities now supported by the 
GSEs, such as home buyer education. 

Fifth, portfolio limits should be regulated, and not legislated. The 
GSEs’ retained portfolios help support affordable housing programs, 
and also help provide financing for low-income borrowers. 
For example, Freddie Mac reports that approximately 300 million 
of the mortgages in the retained portfolio qualify under their affordable 
housing goals. We believe the best way to ensure safety is 
for a strong regulator to limit portfolio risk, and moderate portfolio 
growth, when appropriate. 

Finally, Realtors support increasing the conforming loan limits 
for high-cost areas, and we would like to thank Chairman Frank 
and Representative Miller for their support on this important 
issue, and for including the Miller amendment language in H.R.

HR1892 hearing.txt,"First, the Frank-Waters bill permits only first-time home buyers to participate in a new low and no down payment loan program. My bill allows any FHA-qualified borrower to participate in the new FHA low loan program. Second, the Frank-Waters bill authorizes the FHA to implement risk-based pricing but it leaves in place the current outdated premium caps of 2.25 percent up-front and 0.55 percent annually. And the zero and lower down payment loans would have the higher caps. My concern is that these limits on premium caps will prevent FHA from serving riskier borrowers who could be prudently served by charging a slightly higher premium. With the flexibility to charge slightly higher premiums, FHA would be able to serve borrowers with the lower FICO scores who are currently being served only by the subprime market at very high interest rates. With FHA mortgage insurance, lenders will charge borrowers the market mortgage interest rate. Without FHA insurance, they have no choice but to turn the borrower away or to charge for a risk in an increased mortgage interest rate. Just like last year’s House-passed bill, my bill implements premium caps, and enables the FHA to reach down and serve riskier 
borrowers, but in a prudent manner. The up-front premium is limited to a maximum of 3.0 percent, and the annual premium to a maximum of 2.0 percent.    
Third, my legislation includes another bipartisan agreement reached last year, the automatic reduction of annual premiums to no more than 55 basis points for loans that remain active after 5 years. Automatic premium reductions can be a good thing. They can reduce refinancing and perhaps some defaults and foreclosures 
as well. In contrast, the Franks-Waters bill requires the refund of excess up-front premiums charged to higher risk borrowers, those with FICO scores below 560. I am concerned that this provision could have unintended consequences of limiting the number of borrowers 
that could be served by the FHA program because it may 
require initial premiums to be even higher. The refund provision would also be very difficult to implement. It is inevitable in an insurance fund that lower risk borrowers will subsidize higher risk borrowers. Refunds of this nature undercut the concept of insurance and is the logical equivalent of a healthy person requiring a
100 percent refund of his or her health insurance premiums or a driver who does not get into an accident demanding his car insurance back. ",21
GSE hearing.txt,"First, the GSEs need a strong regulator and sound corporate governance. 
Regulatory oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 
Federal Home Loan Bank should be transferred to a new regulator 


8 


which has the authority to set capital standards, liquidate a financially 
unstable enterprise, and approve new programs and products. 
The regulators should also understand and support the GSEs’ 
vital housing finance mission and the role housing plays in supporting 
our national economy. 

Realtors also support legislative efforts to strengthen the governance 
of the Federal Home Loan Banks, by raising the number of 
independent directors, adding community and economic development 
expertise, and allowing appointed independent directors to 
continue their service until a successor is in place. 

Second, the GSEs’ vital housing mission should be preserved and 
protected. This mission ensures that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
provide capital to the market during downturns, and use their Federal 
ties to facilitate mortgage finance, and support homeownership 
opportunities. The GSEs’ housing mission is vital to the continued 
success of the housing market. Realtors will oppose legislative proposals 
which diminish that. 

Third, the GSEs must be able to develop new products and programs 
that respond to market needs. The standards for approving 
new products and programs should be those contained in the Federal 
National Mortgage Association Charter Act, and the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act. We support requiring the 
GSEs to provide notice to the regulator, so that adequate safety, 
soundness, and mission review can be accomplished. 

We oppose requirements that could unduly delay or prevent the 
GSEs from developing new programs and products that support 
their missions. 

Fourth, there should be no overly restrictive bright line test that 
explicitly limits the GSEs’ role in the secondary market, strictly defined. 
Realtors believe such a test would seriously hinder important 
mission-related consumer outreach activities now supported by the 
GSEs, such as home buyer education. 

Fifth, portfolio limits should be regulated, and not legislated. The 
GSEs’ retained portfolios help support affordable housing programs, 
and also help provide financing for low-income borrowers. 
For example, Freddie Mac reports that approximately 300 million 
of the mortgages in the retained portfolio qualify under their affordable 
housing goals. We believe the best way to ensure safety is 
for a strong regulator to limit portfolio risk, and moderate portfolio 
growth, when appropriate. 

Finally, Realtors support increasing the conforming loan limits 
for high-cost areas, and we would like to thank Chairman Frank 
and Representative Miller for their support on this important 
issue, and for including the Miller amendment language in H.R.

Second, our proposal seeks to provide FHA the flexibility to set insurance

doing, we could reach deeper into the pool of prospective borrowers 
while protecting the financial soundness of the FHA mortgage insurance 
fund. 

Lastly, I would like to mention the proposed increase in FHA 
loan limits. By increasing the loan limits to 65 percent and 100 
percent of the conforming loan limit, which we support, FHA would 
once again be a player in high cost areas, regions that have previously 
been out of play, such as the entire State of California and 
most of the Northeast. What is more, raising the floor to 65 percent 
of the conforming loan limit has the added benefit of giving families 
better access to newly constructed housing, which is on average 
more costly. ",21

Families legislation, would convert the Section 8 voucher 
program to a block grant, transferring its administration to 
the 50 States, and giving them discretion over allocation of 
funds, directly or indirectly.
    Section 8 supports over 4 million apartments. Roughly 1 in 
7 renters nationwide benefit from some form of Section 8 
assistance. Of the 4 million Section 8 households, about 35 
percent, or 1.4 million, have portable vouchers. The HANF 
proposal would fundamentally change the Federal funding system 
for tenant based housing assistance, from one based on actual 
cost to a block grant that simply distributes Federal 
appropriations among States.
    With the passage of HUD's funding year 2003 budget, block 
granting the program to States for this reason is unnecessary 
as the problem of under utilized vouchers has already been 
addressed. If funding levels fall behind the program's needs,

million deal that required 14 separate sources of funds and had 
problems closing the last financial gap, delaying the project for 18 
months, which only drove up the costs more and created a cyclical 
problem. 

It is precisely the type of development that could have been funded 
through this Act, particularly given its targeting. 

If there were more Federal funds available, it would have meant 
a quicker development process and ultimately more public benefit. 

Our St. John of God & St. Jean Baptiste developments, also in 
Massachusetts, are very similar. They could have used this trust 
fund enormously. 

Finally, the Saint Aidan, which is a 59 unit mixed-income development 
located in Brookline, Massachusetts—in Brookline, by the 
way, the median family house price for a single family home last 
year was $1 million. With prices like that, what happens is that 
the teachers, firefighters, and librarians have to enter town in the 
morning and leave town at night; the people who serve you can no 
longer afford to live in the communities with you. 

Saint Aidan’s, though, will be 60 percent affordable, and in this 
case we are fortunate enough to have had Chairman Frank as our 
Representative, with the benefit of his leadership to solve a number 
of problems with the project and for that, we, and the Archdiocese, 
are enormously grateful.

has taken us to get that development out of the ground, by giving 
us additional resources.

dedication to abolishing discrimination based on race, based on 
religion, based on gender, based on age, based on handicaps. 
There have been court opinions. There have been statutes. There 
have been regulations. There have been executive orders. The 
President's proposal appears to me to be a turning back of that 
clock. It sanctions discrimination. Indeed, we have previously 
held that while you might have a right to discriminate purely 
privately, the receipt of Federal funds gives you an even 
greater obligation not to discriminate. This proposal turns 
that on its head. People who receive Federal funds as we have 
interpreted this, and it has not been refuted, religious groups 
who receive Federal funds for secular purposes will be allowed 
to discriminate on religious grounds. That seems to me a 
terrible retreat from the principle of non-discrimination to 
which we have been committed.

housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may

frequently move. We know children who stay in the same home

and do better in school.

Public Health Commission, local community development corporations, 
and some State-funded housing developments, the ability for 
State or local governments to match the best local solution to the 
greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research

wrong direction. 

There appears here to be a clear conflict of vision. I think past 
government housing programs have actually done very little, if you 
look at the record, to increase homeownership levels in this country. 
We do not have much to show for the tens of billions of dollars 
we spent on housing through HUD and FHA, but there is a way 
to improve homeownership rates. 

They improve when real interest rates are low and when consumer 
incomes are high. Under that kind of an environment people 
can afford to frankly get into a position where they can buy their 
own home. I believe limited government and free market policies 
will generate these results; creeping socialism will not. It will work 
more as an anchor on the economy and prosperity. It will keep the 
private sector from becoming as vibrant and creating the opportunities 
for people so that they can move up. 

This fund will waste resources. It’s going to provide false hope 
for those who wish to increase homeownership. Additionally this 
fund will create a terrible precedent, a terrible, terrible precedent

conclusion. What we are asking for in this extension of HOPE VI 
is to get the time to make those conclusions. In Atlanta, for 
example, we have had enough money to deal with maybe 13 
projects in one phase or another, but there are 33 on the 
drawing boards. Each one of these cases have proven your point 
on a point-by-point basis. Will they be well-maintained? In 
Atlanta, we have one of our projects in a place called Eastlake 
Meadows. Eastlake Meadows was the site two years ago of the 
United States PGA Golf Classic, which was won by Tiger Woods. 
Because of where it was, it attracted international attention 
and comments on television about how well the project was 
maintained; how well it looked; the attractiveness of it.
    Centennial Place--right in Centennial Center, right in the 
heart of where we had the Olympics; right next door to the 
headquarters of the Coca-Cola Company, the most famous image in 
the world--mixed income, being successful. And then you get to 
the point of the single-headed households of females, who are 
single-family heads. A part of the major purpose of this 
program is to take that very targeted group and give them hope, 
to sustain them. The program is doing its duty and its good.
    Your other point--best use of the land. Not only is it the 
best use of the land, but the land surrounding that area has 
increased in Atlanta to a value of over $2 billion in the worth 
of the land surrounding it, and has proven to be the most 
effective, valuable economic generators in the Atlanta

    So when we look at this economy I think, and the sector of 
African Americans especially and the squeeze on the middle 
class, the squeeze of middle class jobs, which are basically 
manufacturing jobs, and the loss of this has been directly tied 
to what I see as a very warped trade policy that in effect 
rewards companies and gives tax incentives for our companies to

housing can be a medical intervention and can make kids better 
and keep them healthy. In my pediatric practice, I take care of a 
child, Whitney, whom I met when she was 9 months old. Her family 
was homeless at the time because they could not afford an 
apartment. 

At the time, she was falling off her growth chart. She already 
was having trouble growing. And over the next 3 months, she literally 
gained less than a pound. I needed to hospitalize her because 
she had become dangerously malnourished. 

She ended up needing to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 
because she had an underlying problem with swallowing, and 
she stayed there for over a month. You can imagine the cost of that 
to insurance. When she was at the rehabilitation hospital, she was 
able to gain weight, but as soon as she went back to the shelter, 
she began to lose weight again. 

After advocating with lawyers from our medico-legal partnership 
at Boston Medical Center, Whitney and her family were finally offered 
an affordable home at a local public housing development. 
Once in her new apartment and she was living there, she was able 
to gain weight, and within months her developmental delays improved 
and she was able to thrive. I recently saw Whitney at her 
physical a few months ago, and at 4 years old, she was starting to 
learn to read. 

I tried my best to treat Whitney. I gave her all my medical expertise, 
including very expensive medical care during hospitalizations.

made her well, was a safe, decent, affordable home. ",20

NHTF Hearing.txt,"If I could just add one quick things about schools. 
You are absolutely right that the data all show that children whose 
families can’t afford basic housing are in constant motion, and so 
they are moving from school to school, which means they get further 
and further behind. 

But it is not just the kids who are moving that are affected. It 
is the other kids in the classroom and the teachers because when 
you have a lot of churning in schools and you have new kids coming 
into the classroom mid-year, two or three times a year, the 
teachers have to double back to pick those kids up, which means 
the other kids are getting less attention. 

And it ultimately means that those schools, their test scores 
don’t keep up. Their test scores go down, which means that higher-
income people aren’t going to go to that school. It all has a spiraling-
down effect, so I think that it is important to understand the 
systematic impact beyond the individual child to the entire educational 
system. And there is a fair amount of research in the education 
literature that really gets at all of that. ",20
HR1892 hearing.txt,"If I could respond to that, and also to your 
first question as to the differences. Under the premium structure, 
Madam Chairwoman, that you have versus the Biggert bill, by having 
a cap of 2.25 percent versus a cap of 3 percent, that precludes 
us from being able to help lower income, higher risk borrowers because 
of the actuarial requirements of the mutual mortgage insurance 
fund. While I can understand why you would have your cap, 
and Mrs. Biggert has hers, we would propose, and so support as 
we did last year, to have the maximum flexibility. And that is one 
of the reasons for some of the predicament that we are in on the 
subprime—to be able to go to 3 percent because as you heard me 
say previously, looking at the difference between FHA even at 3 
percent, by the way, the difference between 3 percent—1 percent 


11 


and 3 percent on a $225,000 loan is about $26. And you heard me 
say with the subprime borrowers at 3 points above par, the difference 
on that $225,000 home is about $300 a month. So, again, 
we think by having the 3 percent, would some borrowers like that? 
It gives them flexibility. We can reach lower income, lower FICO 
score borrowers, including many subprime borrowers whom we cannot 
reach today. ",21

make a down payment, scaling back the maximum up-front fee 
from 3 percent to 2.25 percent and the maximum annual fee from 

2.2 percent to .55 percent. These reductions will reduce FHA closing 
cost premiums for a hypothetical family buying a $300,000

payment loans and for borrowers who represent a higher credit 
risk. The bill gives HUD the authority to require pre-purchase 
counseling for riskier borrowers, requires a number of disclosures

loans, and provides the borrower opt-in to receive notice of 
availability of counseling in the event a borrower falls behind in 
their loan payments. FHA has very strong loss mitigation measures

are widely supported.

than a standard Federal bureaucracy and it can be done using very 
entrepreneurial kind of private sector models and done very 
straightforwardly. 

The HOME program is not deep enough. It does not get to the 
30 percent in the way it is operated in most communities. It is not 
operative in that way.

NHTF Hearing.txt,"Madam Chairwoman. Madam Chairwoman, 
I must again express my adamant opposition to this legislation 
and the idea here of creating what is called the Affordable 
Housing Fund. As I have expressed since its inception, this fund 
is straight out of Central Planning 101. This is really a step in the 
wrong direction. 

There appears here to be a clear conflict of vision. I think past 
government housing programs have actually done very little, if you 
look at the record, to increase homeownership levels in this country. 
We do not have much to show for the tens of billions of dollars 
we spent on housing through HUD and FHA, but there is a way 
to improve homeownership rates. 

They improve when real interest rates are low and when consumer 
incomes are high. Under that kind of an environment people 
can afford to frankly get into a position where they can buy their 
own home. I believe limited government and free market policies 
will generate these results; creeping socialism will not. It will work 
more as an anchor on the economy and prosperity. It will keep the 
private sector from becoming as vibrant and creating the opportunities 
for people so that they can move up. 

This fund will waste resources. It’s going to provide false hope 
for those who wish to increase homeownership. Additionally this 
fund will create a terrible precedent, a terrible, terrible precedent 
for other industries in this country. As I said during the GSE and 


9 


FHA debates, I hope that other financial institutions are watching 
this debate because you’re going to be the next targets. 

Proponents of this concept are not going to stop at just assessing 
or taxing GSEs and the Federal Housing Administration. They’re 
going to try to confiscate money once they set up this fund from 
any source they can get it. ",21

CHRG-108hhrg89932.htm,"many of us were alarmed when we learned that the Administration 
was not desirous of reauthorizing HOPE VI. As you know, we all 
have concerns about public housing--the funding for public 
housing, section 8, making more units available, rehab--all of 
that. But HOPE VI has taken on quite a significant meaning for 
distressed housing in this country. While the Administration 
makes the argument that not all of the dollars allocated to 
HOPE VI have been spent, our examination of this issue does not 
lead us to conclude that this is a good reason why HOPE VI 
should not be reauthorized.
    We have learned that the number of applications for it 
outweigh any concerns about whether it is needed. As a matter 
of fact, we believe that if we simply fund it at about 50 
percent of those applications that have been put in, we would 
be going a long way toward providing safe affordable housing 
for so many of our citizens who are in desperate need. Not only 
are we concerned about the lack of reauthorization, we think 
this sends a message. We do not know why, even if you did not 
want to put the dollars into it, if the Administration did not 
want to put the dollars into it, we do not know why you would 
not simply support reauthorization. That is a signal that says, 
we think this program has value. We think that despite the fact 
that all of the dollars have not been spent, we do see progress 
being made.
    We have discovered in our examination of the issue that 
increasingly the housing authorities have reduced the number of 
days that it has taken them to get up to speed, and we think it 
gets even better. We think with the more involvement of the 
private sector and all of that, that these grants can be 
expedited in ways that can put the rehabilitation of housing 
units on line in ways, again, that would make them available to 
people who so desperately need it.

the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future 
generations bearing much of the cost. He said that at a House 
Budget Committee hearing.
    Recently Controller General Walker of GAO said that the 
rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that 
threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could 
bankrupt America. Most of the models I have seen from OMB and 
CBO and others, who slice and dice the numbers here, have us on 
a collision course over the next several decades of either 
having a Federal Government consisting of a little more than 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security or a doubling of taxes

have seen no evidence in this Congress that there is an

are in a situation where the hands of Caesar are carrying

``The hands of Caesar have no place in the institution of

we appreciate Chairman Frank working on is trying to help simplify 
and streamline some of these regulations, but they are very 
different even with the deeper targeting in the HOME program, it 
is not nearly as flexible as the trust fund. 

The trust fund can be used for project-based rental assistance, 
for example. It can be used for a variety of different things that the 
HOME funds currently are not structured in the same way to use. 

So from a developer’s perspective, I think that it is more flexible, 
even with deeper targeting in the HOME program, there is such 
a level of complication with that at this point that I think we are 
better off starting fresh with a proven tool in a trust fund with the

other 80 percent rely on earned income, pensions or disability

housing market conditions and rental housing cost inflation. So 
using the TANF model is inappropriate.
    The uncertainty of block grant funding could have a greater 
impact on the use of vouchers to support home ownership. 
Vouchers can only be used to support home mortgages to the 
extent that mortgage lenders are confident that funding will 
continue to be available for the length of the mortgage.

CHRG-108hhrg88663.htm,"NNCSHA also is grateful to Chairman Ney for introducing the 
Housing Assistance for Needy Families Act. NNCSHA neither 
supports nor opposes this legislation, but we believe it 
deserves Congress' full consideration. NNCSHA supports a 
voucher block grant in concept. However, we have taken a 
neutral stance on the administration's plan because of our 
serious concerns about the adequacy of the program funding and 
flexibility it proposes.
    Section 8 vouchers are one of our most important affordable 
housing tools, but the voucher program is not meeting its 
potential. Its complex rules and regulations block innovation, 
drive up costs, discourage private sector involvement, and 
confuse customers and administrators.
    The decentralization of funding to more than 2,500 PHAs 
complicates program administration, increases costs, prevents 
maximum utilization of funds and frustrates regional and 
statewide housing strategies. If implemented with sufficient 
funding and flexibility, HANF could resolve many of the current 
program's problems and create new opportunities for voucher 
use.
    States have the capacity to administer the voucher program. 
States possess a multi-decade record of responsibility, 
effectiveness, and accountability in administering tens of 
billions of dollars in housing assistance. They possess 
statewide sophisticated financial asset management and 
administrative oversight capability. Many States already 
administer Section 8.
    States are uniquely positioned to administer Federal 
housing resources. They understand local housing needs and 
markets, while bringing a State and regional perspective to 
problems that cannot be solved within municipal boundaries. 
States can ensure housing funding is applied where it is most 
needed and integrated with other public investments in their 
communities.
    Moreover, States have the ability to bring together State 
agencies and resources. State agencies are partners, for 
example, with welfare agencies to coordinate TANF funds with 
housing assistance. The voucher program, adequately funded and 
rationally regulated, would benefit from State administration.
    States' knowledge of local housing markets, access to other 
housing and nonhousing resources, ability to respond to 
changing local circumstances and prioritizing needs across 
States would overcome many of the voucher program's current 
limitations.
    Federal oversight would be more efficiently concentrated on 
50 entities. However, HANF must not be an underfunded mandate. 
We urge Congress to safeguard vouchers and the low income 
families who depend on them by authorizing mandatory voucher 
spending in an amount at least adequate to finance all 
currently authorized vouchers. Authorizing legislation must 
also specify that funds would be adjusted annually to cover 
cost increases.
    To work HANF must be a flexible program. It must be free 
from unnecessary and burdensome Federal requirements. HUD 
regulation must be limited to that necessary to assure 
nondiscrimination and accountability for the use of funds to 
achieve goals Congress sets. Performance standards must not 
compel States to respond to Federal priorities rather than 
their own.
    In conclusion, exploring ways to improve the Section 8 
voucher program is timely and appropriate. A block grant to the 
States merits Congress' examination and NNCSHA is available to 
assist you in that effort.",20

CHRG-108hhrg93838.htm,"One year ago Freddie Mac first revealed that it would delay 
the release of the 2002 accounting reports pending the 
completion of a restatement of its financial records for 
earlier years. This announcement raised considerable concerns 
for those who monitor GSEs. It also began a period of intense 
scrutiny of the company by its regulators, lawmakers and the 
press.
    Six months later, Freddie Mac's Board announced an 
unexpected management shakeup. This change in corporate 
leadership produced even greater concerns among those with 
knowledge of GSEs. For example, I observed that government-
sponsored enterprises with public responsibilities and private 
capital have a special obligation to operate fairly, safely, 
and soundly. I believe and I continue to believe that today. 
The management of these entities must ensure that they produce 
accounting statements that reflect their real financial 
conditions.
    At the time I also said that Freddie Mac must maintain 
sufficient capital reserves, adopt prudent management reforms, 
expedite completion of its earnings restatements, and employ 
appropriate accounting techniques to prevent similar problems 
in the future. I suspect that, before we complete today's 
hearing, we will discuss each of these issues in great depth. 
We have a responsibility to study these matters and ensure that 
the company follows its statutory mandate to operate in a safe 
and sound manner.
    Additionally, the financial reporting problems by Freddie 
Mac renewed efforts by some to modify GSE regulation. As I said 
at our very first hearing on oversight of government-sponsored 
enterprises in March of 2000, we need to have strong 
independent regulators that have the resources they need to get 
the job done. I continue to support strong GSE regulation. A 
strong regulator will protect the continued validity of our 
capital markets and promote confidence in Freddie Mac and 
Fannie Mae. It will also ensure taxpayers against systemic risk 
and expand opportunities for all Americans.
    Today more than 68 percent of Americans own the homes in 
which they live. Government-sponsored enterprises have 
contributed greatly to this accomplishment. Because our housing

was making that same sort of suggestion earlier, in his testimony, 
that as any day you said you open the paper, it goes up and goes 
down, what have you, as far as overall economy in the housing 
market. 

The testimony that we received on this issue in the past when 
that was raised was just contrary, unfortunately, to what you’re 


22 


saying and what Mr. Stern was saying. What this testimony and 
the evidence indicates, reports and studies of GSEs says that instead 
of stepping into the market to pick up where you would hope 
that they would do the good job that they are supposed to by their 
mission, instead what they do, in essence, is to cherry-pick the 
market, and that the private market still has sufficient capacity to 
address it, but the GSEs basically come in as the suitor of the best 
portion of the market, and takes that. And that is what they have 
been holding primarily in their portfolio, even during those downtimes, 
when we wish that the GSEs were doing the job which was 
the core mission to satisfy the underlying market. 

Mr. ROBBINS. I appreciate what you’re saying, Representative. 
What I was saying is in this particular case, there was a day or 
two immediately following all of those events where there was no 
market, other than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The private market 
was not there to support—I sold mortgages through those markets. 
And that’s the kind of events that need the liquidity that we 
are talking about. 

What the MBA proposes is that a world-class regulator— 

Mr. GARRETT. Yes, but again, that goes to what—Chairman 
Greenspan testified on those points, because we addressed the 
exact same points after the fact. 

Mr. ROBBINS. Well, I can tell you, after the First Gulf War, there 
was no market for 2 days following the announcement of the war. 
The mortgage-backed securities market was unavailable, while it 
tried to reprice itself. 

Mr. GARRETT. And GSEs were in during those 2 days, picking up 
all those periods? 

Mr. ROBBINS. That’s correct. 

Mr. GARRETT. And that lasted after the 2-day period? 

Mr. ROBBINS. They posted a price, if memory serves, the afternoon 
that it was announced, and had a price the following morning. 

But beyond that issue, that’s why we feel that a world-class regulator 
should make the determination on what that portfolio size 
should be, and what the leverage should be on that. We know that 
outstanding mortgage debt is going to grow, according to Harvard 
University, some $20 trillion over the course of the next 20 years 
or so. 

And so, it is inconsistent today to sit there and think about what 
would be the right number to attach to the GSEs. That’s why a 
strong regulator, world-class regulator, should be there, both as the 
market rises and falls in size, or rises and falls, should be the one 
to make that determination. 

Mr. GARRETT. Okay. I saw a lot of other hands. 

Mr. MENZIES. I would be the very last to question Mr. 
Bernanke’s economic logic on the rise and fall of prices in the secondary 
market. As a community banker, I do know, however, that 
we need access to that market. And the 5,000-some community 
banks that belong to ICBA are basically small banks. We are little 
banks, and I don’t know what we compose of the total secondary 
market, but it’s not a whole lot; it’s a fairly small percentage of the 
whole. 

So, having access to that market is critical. If you were to theorize 
that reducing the size of the portfolio, and setting capital lim



23 


its, and reducing the quantity of loans that Freddie Mac and 
Fannie Mae can guarantee would, in fact, improve market prices, 
that is possible, I guess. 

Mr. GARRETT. Well, no one is suggesting that would reduce the 
amount of loans that they are—would be able to go secure from 
them, but simply that they would no longer be holding the mortgages 
as they have, but instead would do what their core function 
is, to securitize those loans. 

Right now, one of the other testimonies was a testimony that 
they are only holding around a third of their loan in their—which 
is basically their core function—the secondary market loans. 

By reducing their overall portfolio to just a limitation in that 
area, how would that reduce your ability of liquidating in a market, 
if they were securitizing the rest of the market? 

Mr. MENZIES. Well, yes, if you believe that is the case, then that 
would not hurt community banks. I think our concern is that it 
could hurt community banks if it reduced our access to the market. 

Mr. GARRETT. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Menzies. Mr. Price? Yes, sure. ",21

to the more risky loans that are currently being heavily marketed. 
We believe the FHA could again be a viable, affordable alternative 
for borrowers with less than ideal credit. 

Today, we ask you to advance legislation that would reform the 
FHA Mortgage Insurance Program in several important ways. Increases 
in FHA loan limits are needed not just in high-cost areas, 
but nationwide. Such increases are critical for FHA to assist home 
buyers in places like California but also areas where home prices 
exceed the current maximum limit but are not defined as high cost, 
such as Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona. 

Second, we ask you to eliminate the statutory 3 percent minimum 
down payment on FHA-insured mortgages. In 2005, 43 percent 
of first-time home buyers financed 100 percent of their home. 
NAR research indicates that if FHA were allowed to offer this option, 
1.6 million families could benefit, including many low-income 
and minority home buyers. Eliminating the statutory 3 percent 
minimum cash investment will provide consumers a safe option 
away from non-traditional products. 

Third, NAR supports legislation that would provide FHA with 
the ability to charge borrowers different premiums based on risks 
of the borrowers and type of loan product. Currently, all FHA borrowers, 
regardless of risk, pay virtually the same premiums and receive 
the same interest rate. Giving FHA the flexibility to charge 
different borrowers different premiums based on risk will allow 
FHA to increase their pool of borrowers. Risk-based pricing makes 
sense in the private market and does for FHA as well. 

Fourth, NAR supports moving the Condo Program into the 203(b) 
Program and combining all single family programs into the Mutual 
Mortgage Insurance Fund. From a conceptual and accounting 
standpoint, it makes sound business sense to place all single family 
programs under the MMIF. We also recommend that HUD lift 
many of the barriers that make condominium purchase difficult 
under FHA. We believe the current policies limit sales and home

the teachers, firefighters, and librarians have to enter town in the

In addition, H.R. 1852 includes a number of important changes 
to the FHA bill that passed the House last year. First, it eliminates 
the fee increases from last year’s bill for borrower who continue to 
make a down payment, scaling back the maximum up-front fee 
from 3 percent to 2.25 percent and the maximum annual fee from 

2.2 percent to .55 percent. These reductions will reduce FHA closing 
cost premiums for a hypothetical family buying a $300,000 
home by $2,250 in annual fees over a 5-year period of $20,000 compared 
to last year’s bill. 
The bill also adds a number of home buyer protections not included 
in last year’s bill for families taking out riskier zero-down 
payment loans and for borrowers who represent a higher credit 
risk. The bill gives HUD the authority to require pre-purchase 
counseling for riskier borrowers, requires a number of disclosures 
spelling out the costs and risk of zero down and lower down payment 
loans, and provides the borrower opt-in to receive notice of 
availability of counseling in the event a borrower falls behind in 
their loan payments. FHA has very strong loss mitigation measures 
in place so the borrower protections in the bill are a plus that 
are widely supported. ",20

CHRG-108hhrg88663.htm,"The HANF proposal would fundamentally 
change the Federal funding systems for tenant-based housing 
assistance from one based on actual cost to a block grant that 
simply distributes Federal appropriations among States. One of 
the Stated goals of the administration for HANF is to improve 
the under utilization of the Section 8 program. However, with 
the recent passage of HUD's funding year 2003 budget, block 
granting the program to States for this reason is unnecessary, 
as the problem of under utilized vouchers has already been 
addressed. The budget provides only enough funds to ensure that 
every family currently assisted under the program will continue 
to be assisted, rather than continuing the policy of funding 
all vouchers, even if they are not being used.
    Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Kit 
Bond, in a Statement at a March 6, 2003 subcommittee hearing, 
said, and I quote, in my opinion, HANF is premature. The VA-HUD 
funding 2003 appropriations bill created a new funding 
structure for Section 8. Vouchers where public housing 
authorities receive the funding for all vouchers in use and for 
any vouchers that can be used up to a PHAs authorized level. 
This funding approach should result in a more realistic 
assessment of Section 8 funding needs, and reduce the need to 
go through the annual ritual of rescinding large amounts of 
unused excess Section 8 assistance. I think it will take 
several years to ensure the reliability of this new funding 
system, but I am optimistic that will become a good gauge of 
both the actual cost and the use of vouchers.
    A January, 2002 GAO report compared the six active Federal 
housing programs and found that Section 8 vouchers were the 
most cost-effective. Historically, funding for block grants 
such as HANF has failed to keep pace with inflation. Under 
HANF, funding levels would be based on inflation-adjusted 
figures, as opposed to current policy which bases renewal 
funding on actual housing costs. Between 1998 and 2003, rents 
rose by 25 percent. Over the same period of time, the consumer 
price index increased by 12 percent. Even at inflation-adjusted 
levels as suggested by the administration, housing assistance 
is likely to erode steadily under HANF.
    If funding levels fall behind the program's needs, as 
likely will occur, States will either have to contribute their 
own funds to the program or reduce assistance to low-income 
families and elderly and disabled individuals in one or more of 
the following ways: reduction of the number of families that 
receive housing vouchers, despite the fact that three out of 
four low-income families eligible for vouchers already go 
without assistance because of funding limitations. A reduction 
in the number of vouchers would make the shortage of affordable 
housing even larger by cutting costs, by shifting assistance to 
higher-income families. Such families need smaller subsidies to 
be able to afford housing. As a result, the average cost of 
providing housing vouchers to these families is smaller than 
the cost of serving poor families. Also cutting costs by 
shifting rental burdens to families participating in the 
program. This can be accomplished by requiring families to pay 
more than 30 percent of their income for rent, or reducing the 
total amount of rent that a voucher could cover, thereby making 
fewer housing units accessible to voucher families.
    There is a lot more here, but I think that which I have 
shared with you basically describes my concerns about HANF. I 
am very, very worried about this program, Mr. Chairman. This is 
one of the most significant programs to assist poor people that 
we have in this country. I come from a State where we have a 
$35 billion deficit. If you block grant that money to my state, 
they are going to take some of it and use it for other things. 
Or if they needed to subsidize it in any way, they could not do 
it because we just do not have the money.",20

Such a regulatory system will promote confidence in the GSEs, protect

regulatory system, like the bill we passed in the 109th Congress, 
should adhere to several key principles. 

For example, the regulator must have a funding stream, separate 
and apart from the annual appropriations process. In order to be 
credible and effective, the regulator must additionally have genuine 
independence from the political system. Such independence must 
consist of complete autonomy from the enterprises, include sufficient 
protection from outside special interests, and provide for substantial 
insulation from political interference. 

A strong regulator must further have robust supervisory and enforcement 
powers. In this regard, many have suggested that we 
should model GSEs safety and soundness regulation on that of 
other financial institutions. I agree with this sensible concept. 

In fact, the general goal of our longstanding regulatory reform 
debates has been to make GSE supervision more bank-like. Any 
safety and soundness regulator for the housing GSEs needs to have 
enforcement powers on par with other Federal banking regulators. 
As we proceed in the coming weeks, I also hope that we will continue 
to remember why we created these public/private entities. We

this committee apparently is to raise taxes on hardworking American 
people. Make no mistake about it. This bill would impose a 
very creative de facto mortgage tax on hardworking Americans trying 
to pay for their homes. 

Although I do not question people’s motives and I believe their 
hearts and motives are pure, many on this committee with their 
votes have made housing less affordable. If we truly want to make 
housing more affordable, we need to realize there is no greater 
housing program in American than a good job. And since we have 
enacted pro-growth tax policies in 2003, we have had 8.2 million 
new jobs created. And yet many in this House and many on the 
committee want the tax relief to go away. And, as you take away 
the tax relief, you begin to take away the jobs. 

Secondly, if we truly care about affordable housing, we need to 
realize how the single largest tax increase in American history contained 
within the Democrat budget resolution, how that impacts 
families who are trying to make their homes affordable. 

I hear from constituents in my district. I hear from the Brucker 
Family in Wills Point who writes, ‘‘No increase in taxes. My family 
is only one breath away from losing our home as it is.’’ 

I hear from the Stevens Family in Forney, Texas, ‘‘If our taxes 
increased $2,755, we would not be able to pay our mortgage.’’ And 
the list goes on and on and on. We need to realize that more spending 
fuels more taxes which makes homes less affordable. 

Third, it seems ironic to me that we would increase taxes on 
some, make housing less affordable for many low- and middle-income 
Americans because we know that Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac are an effectively a government protected duopoly. They have 
great economic power to simply pass along these fees or taxes, if

do to improve voucher utilization, some of which were in H.R. 
3995, your omnibus housing bill from the last Congress, and in 
bills in the Senate. First, HUD has the option to reallocate 
unused vouchers from one administering agency to another, and 
Congress should require reallocation from communities that 
cannot use all their housing vouchers to those who can, and to 
the extent possible keep those housing vouchers in the same 
region. The threshold for reallocation should be quite high, a 
95 percent utilization rate.
    Second, Congress should enact reforms that will incentivize 
owners of rental property to participate in the program, in 
particular making the inspection process more flexible and less 
time consuming for owners, a proposal that was detailed in H.R. 
3995. And third, Congress should establish a housing success 
fund or other mechanism to help housing voucher holders find 
and access available housing with funds for application fees, 
credit checks, security deposits and the like, as well as 
supporting housing search assistance, outreach and counseling 
and those kinds of things.
    We know that some landlords decline to accept housing 
vouchers because they object to the people who are voucher 
holders. Congress should consider a testing program that would 
attempt to discern the extent to which discrimination against 
voucher holders violates Federal fair housing laws. Ultimately, 
the success of the housing voucher program does depend on the 
availability of safe and affordable housing.",20

excess up-front premiums charged to higher risk borrowers, those 
with FICO scores below 560. I am concerned that this provision 
could have unintended consequences of limiting the number of borrowers 
that could be served by the FHA program because it may 
require initial premiums to be even higher. The refund provision 
would also be very difficult to implement. It is inevitable in an insurance 
fund that lower risk borrowers will subsidize higher risk 
borrowers. Refunds of this nature undercut the concept of insurance

resources to the greatest relative needs within their jurisdictions. 

Second, we suggest that you eliminate overly complex and unnecessary

combination of other trust funds with other housing resources, and 
add time and therefore cost to the development and compliance 
process. 

Third, we suggest to the committee that you make the match requirement 
sufficiently flexible that it does not deny jurisdictions 
funding they want and need by, for example, limiting it to 25 percent, 
as the HOME program requires, and giving States equal credit 
for investment of Federal and non-Federal resources in trust 
properties and programs. 

And finally, and very importantly, Mr. Chairman we suggest this 
committee and Congress create a source of long-term operating 
support for rental properties housing extremely-low-income families.

GSE hearing.txt,"Today, it is unclear whether certain current GSE activities are 
actually permitted. The new regulator needs sufficient authority to 
solve this problem. MBA has reviewed the recently introduced bill, 

H.R. 121. We believe that the product approval language heads in 
the right direction to satisfy some of these concerns, and we strongly 
oppose any effort to weaken it. 
We particularly support the no limitation clause at the end of 
this section on powers to review new and existing products or activities. 
This is essential authority for a world class financial regulator. 


We appreciate that H.R. 121 calculates the size of the contribution 
to the affordable housing fund on the GSEs’ portfolio, rather 
than on net income. This approach would make it more difficult for 
the GSEs to pass the cost of their contribution on to mortgage lenders 
and consumers. It would also tie a benefit of government sponsorship, 
the lower capital cost, to the GSEs’ affordable housing contributions. ",20

HR1892 hearing.txt,"Today, we ask you to advance legislation that would reform the 
FHA Mortgage Insurance Program in several important ways. Increases 
in FHA loan limits are needed not just in high-cost areas, 
but nationwide. Such increases are critical for FHA to assist home 
buyers in places like California but also areas where home prices 
exceed the current maximum limit but are not defined as high cost, 
such as Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona. 

Second, we ask you to eliminate the statutory 3 percent minimum 
down payment on FHA-insured mortgages. In 2005, 43 percent 
of first-time home buyers financed 100 percent of their home. 
NAR research indicates that if FHA were allowed to offer this option, 
1.6 million families could benefit, including many low-income 
and minority home buyers. Eliminating the statutory 3 percent 
minimum cash investment will provide consumers a safe option 
away from non-traditional products. 

Third, NAR supports legislation that would provide FHA with 
the ability to charge borrowers different premiums based on risks 
of the borrowers and type of loan product. Currently, all FHA borrowers, 
regardless of risk, pay virtually the same premiums and receive 
the same interest rate. Giving FHA the flexibility to charge 
different borrowers different premiums based on risk will allow 
FHA to increase their pool of borrowers. Risk-based pricing makes 
sense in the private market and does for FHA as well. 

Fourth, NAR supports moving the Condo Program into the 203(b) 
Program and combining all single family programs into the Mutual 
Mortgage Insurance Fund. From a conceptual and accounting 
standpoint, it makes sound business sense to place all single family 
programs under the MMIF. We also recommend that HUD lift 
many of the barriers that make condominium purchase difficult 
under FHA. We believe the current policies limit sales and home

funding cuts over time, and that is unacceptable.
    In addition, it does not give States the flexibility they 
would truly need to achieve the efficiencies that the

we would need to see guaranteed funding, mandatory spending,

for example. States would need to know from year to year that 
they were going to get sufficient funds, not only to provide 
for the families who currently receive them, but to cover 
increased costs over time. And, frankly, we would like to see 
new voucher program money in this program. No new vouchers have 
been appropriated by Congress for several years, yet only one

In smaller communities, many that are in high-cost areas, such

self-defeating provisions in both the GSE reform bill and the FHA 
reauthorization bill, low- and middle-income Americans, including 
the elderly, will have to foot the bill. 

Specifically, it’s estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
two entities that purchased or securitized almost 80 percent of 
American families’ mortgages, will be taxed more than $3 billion 
over a 5-year period to help pay for the trust fund. As publicly 
traded companies accountable to their shareholders, Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac will inevitably seek to pass along these new assessments 
to their customers, America’s low- and middle-income 
homeowners. 

This is unacceptable and will result in what amounts to a mortgage 
tax on these hardworking low- and middle-income Americans 
seeking to secure, maintain, or refinance their home mortgages. To 
me, it’s robbing Peter to save Paul. 

And then second, CBO has estimated that FHA reauthorization 
bill could result in a $370 million surplus in 2008 and a $2.1 billion 
surplus over the 2008 to 2012 period. Now normally we would say 
that the surplus is a good thing, but not in this case. In this case 
the surplus would come through overcharging seniors on their reverse 
mortgages, and I don’t think that’s right. 


7 


By far the majority of this FHA surplus would come from reverse 
mortgages premiums paid by our seniors, suggesting that they 
have been overcharged. As you know I have supported the ideas 
aimed at giving the surplus back to our seniors in the form of reduced 
premiums, which this committee rejected. By using the reverse 
mortgage product as a moneymaker to finance a National 
Housing Trust Fund, this bill instead instructs FHA to continue 
overcharging and essentially taxing our seniors. Our seniors deserve 
better. 

At the same time, this bill removes all surplus funds out of FHA, 
which I believe threatens the solvency of the FHA fund and its 
ability to pay out on insurance claims. 

Third, a National Housing Trust Fund unnecessarily adds another 
Federal housing program to the over 100 programs that already 
exist. The National Low Income Housing Coalition cites 
nearly 600 housing trust funds that have been created in cities, 
counties, and States of this country generating more than $1.6 billion 
per year to support housing needs. 

For example, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund in Illinois allocates 
approximately $16 million to $20 million each year to benefit 
low- and very-low-income households. Additionally, the Illinois 
Rental Housing Support Program provides rent subsidies for an estimated 
4,000 rent burdened households. 

I think that these regionally tailored programs work best because 
they allow funds to be tailored to localized housing and community 
development needs. Also, to the extent that Federal programs fall 
short in some way, I must point out the existing federally administered 
program designed to serve the housing needs of low-income 
Americans, the Home Investment Partnership Program. This program 
already has the personnel, systems, and regulatory oversight 
in place to accomplish the same objectives as the National Housing 
Trust Fund. 

Rather than create a new Federal bureaucracy to address low-income 
housing availability, we should instead focus our efforts on 
improving the HOME program. ",21

meet your obligations, if you work very hard and pay back what 
you owe, why should you pay more than somebody who makes far 
more money than you because other people in your situation previously 
defaulted? 

Now the gentlewoman said, ‘‘Well, that rule was strict, what is 
available?’’ No, only if you consider the higher credit risk people to 
be a closed pot. I, along with the gentlewoman from California, 
have been preaching, and I think finally we are going to win and 
we are going to admit California, Massachusetts, and New York to 
the Union. We are going to allow them to fully participate in Federal 
housing programs: FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. They 
have been somewhat excluded for some time. That will generate 
some revenues, and we intend to take some of the additional revenues 
generated within this set of programs and use them to make 
the radical proposition—that if you are of a higher credit risk and 
you borrow money and you get your mortgage insurance from the 
FHA and you pay back every penny you were supposed to, that you 
will not be charged more by your own Federal Government—true. 
That is the best thing we can do about the subprime market. 

And there was also a comparison to insurance. Well, this is the 
Federal Government. I do not think that the Federal Government 
ought to—I know there is a dispute about whether or not we 
should help the poor at the expense of the wealthy but is there 
really an argument that we should penalize lower income people by 
charging them more for exactly the same mortgage insurance as 
someone who makes 3 times as much because somebody else who 
makes the same amount they do did not pay it back? So, yes, that 
is what we are saying. We are saying that if the FHA is to generate 
surpluses, as it has for 12 years, rather than that money 
going for earmarks in the agricultural surpluses and wars and 
trips and other things, it should be recycled to some extent for affordable 
housing, which does help everybody as you add to housing. 
One of the problems we have had is a housing program whereby 
we have only done vouchers so we have added to the demand for

housing without increasing the supply. And we also believe that in 
dealing with people in the subprime category, we should extend to 
them the ability to go to the FHA and be helped. And if they make
