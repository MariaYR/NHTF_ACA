NHTF Hearing.txt," First, the national 
housing trust fund is important because it is such a focused 
tool. Across the entire spectrum of housing, starting with housing 
shelters and supportive housing and subsidized rentals and public 
housing, market rentals, entry level home ownership and move up 
housing across that entire continuum, the greatest need, the greatest 
suffering is among families, individuals, and households below 
30 percent of median income, the extremely-low-income families of 
our country. 

To address their needs, to produce housing that touches the entire 
first part of this continuum, from homelessness through these 
various first steps, we need units, production, and housing stock, 
that low-income people can access. 

We need units so that homeless people can access the Housing 
First concept. We have to have housing units for them to be able 
to move out of homelessness. 

We need supportive housing with services. We need low-income 
rental stock. I am in the home ownership business personally, but 
I acknowledge the absolute most pressing need before the country 
in housing is the lowest income rental stock. 

We need housing that works with other programs, such as public 
housing, and we need housing that works in conjunction with market 
housing, so that flexibility is possible to take something like

this fund and match it to market housing, 20 percent or 25 percent 
of a market development.

or on this scale. We need this focused new production program.

American Dream Downpayment Assistance Act, which is the government

rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that 
threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could 
bankrupt America. Most of the models I have seen from OMB and

a collision course over the next several decades of either 
having a Federal Government consisting of a little more than

from the others.",15
NHTF Hearing.txt," I am here today to support H.R. 2895, 
the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 

I am also here today to share new evidence that shows that 
housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may 


67 


frequently move. We know children who stay in the same home 
and do not more frequently have better child development outcomes 
and do better in school. 

Another aspect of the bill that I think is excellent is the local 
flexibility. From my experience working in Boston with the Boston 
Public Health Commission, local community development corporations, 
and some State-funded housing developments, the ability for 
State or local governments to match the best local solution to the 
greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I 
urge you to support H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing 
Trust Fund bill, because it can ensure that our most vulnerable 
population, our children, have safe, decent, and affordable homes. ",15

that one of the most important things that this Congress can do as 
we search for ways to help those who have been harmed by the 
subprime market is to give FHA the tools it needs to be a viable 
alternative for first time and lower income borrowers. That is why 
this hearing on FHA modernization is both timely and critical. By 
modernizing FHA we can provide another alternative for low-income 
borrowers who may otherwise be forced into higher cost 
subprime loans or even predatory products. By moving quickly to

thousands of lower income credit-worthy borrowers looking to either

That assumes that they are working and earning some revenue so that they can, indeed, make a down payment on a home. And I am of the opinion that full employment ought to be one of the goals of this government.
  Every time unemployment dips below 5 percent, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve uses employment growth to say that the economy is overheating and as a rationale to raise interest rates, slow the economy, and slow unemployment. Welfare reform promised to move many of the recipients who are on public-assisted housing to work, but if the Fed maintains its present policy, not only will the unemployed increase and the underemployed remain, but the rejected workers will have no government assistance.

my friend from Texas on a lot of issues, and there are a lot of areas 
where this committee can cooperate across party lines, but nowhere 
have the differences that do exist between the parties been made 
more clear than in his last statement when he described the effort 
by the gentlewoman from California and myself to provide more 
funding for affordable housing as ‘‘extortion.’’ The FHA is a Federal 
agency created by Federal law. And the notion that it is ‘‘extortion’’ 
to try to use some of the surplus funds it has been generating to 
help provide affordable housing greatly defines the difference between 
the parties. 

I noticed that the gentlewoman from Illinois—who temporarily 
had to leave and who has been a very constructive member also— 
said, ‘‘Well, we should not be using FHA funds for other purposes.’’ 
Maybe she missed this, but during the entire period of Republican 
majority rule, that is exactly what was happening. The FHA was 
producing surpluses which went into the general treasury, and 
they have been used to support such non-housing related issues as 
the war in Iraq, nuclear testing, or anything else the Federal Government 
does. This notion that money should not come from the 
FHA for other purposes is a very new one because the FHA has 
been a money maker for the rest of the Federal Government in the 
past. Now it is true that many of us—including the gentlewoman 
from California and I—believe that if the FHA continues to generate 
surpluses, and we certainly will guarantee that first claim on 
any monies goes to keep the FHA functioning, but the question is 
should the surpluses go into the general treasury and help offset 
everything else the Federal Government does, such as farm subsidies, 
the war in Iraq, bridges to nowhere, and all of those other 
purposes for which it was put, or should we target it towards affordable 
housing? ",15

me to share MBA’s views on reforming the FHA. I have spent over 
36 years working with FHA and have made billions of dollars in 
loan originations to families who have achieved the dream of home-
ownership through FHA’s programs. When I started in the mortgage 
business, FHA programs helped us to serve many borrowers 
who otherwise could not get a loan. Today, the story is very different. 
In 2003, FHA made up approximately 16 percent of our 
overall production. Last year, however, only a little more than 1 
percent of our business went to FHA. While the mortgage market 
has grown significantly, our use of the FHA program has dropped 
precipitously. Lenders have progressed, reacting to quickly changing 
and efficient technology. Unfortunately, FHA has not. While 
the needs of low- and moderate-income home buyers, of first-time 
home buyers, and of senior homeowners have changed, FHA has 
not followed its historic path of adopting to meet borrowers’ changing 
needs. ",15

to reallocate that based on where we see the greatest poverty 
need, not pockets of poverties in wealthy areas. That's a

NCSHA has long advocated for new, flexible, State-administered 
affordable housing production resources to leverage those States 
now administer, like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, to reach 
even lower income families than those resources can reach on their 
own. ",15
CHRG-110hhrg35406.htm," Over the last several years, the Administration has sought 
to change the direction of many of our Nation's housing 
programs. Rather than merely addressing the symptoms, the 
Administration has proposed changes designed to promote 
economic opportunity and ownership and encourage greater self-
sufficiency among our citizens. This budget continues the 
President's commitment to increasing homeownership, and 
fostering an ownership society.",16

all important. ",15
GSE hearing.txt," Representative Garrett, if I could also comment, the 
portfolio, to kind of look at it for what it is, is a source of revenue 
for the GSEs. But they do use that revenue to build the size and 
scale to be relevant, and to provide liquidity to the marketplace. 

The holding of mortgage assets is somewhat of a zero sum game. 
If you take assets away from one entity, such as a GSE, it doesn’t 
disappear; it is reallocated. And in the case of the American housing 
finance system, it would be reallocated to large-scale American 
financial institutions and global financial institutions. 

The only difference is those financial institutions don’t have a 
charter, or a mission to serve the housing finance system, whereas 
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank system 
do. To arbitrarily limit the size of their portfolio based on the 
size of their affordable housing mission, or their affordable housing 
loans, limits their revenue that they could make, and it limits the 
service that they can provide to the housing finance system, in general.",15
HR1892 hearing.txt," so you would suggest to me that we 
could help to straighten out the situation for those who are about 
to be in trouble, or may have gotten into trouble already, so that 
they could refinance and FHA would be able to save them from losing 
their homes right now with this crisis that we have going on, 
is that correct? ",15

NHTF Hearing.txt," the fact that the 
money has been identified from the GSEs is very important. We 
know it is available. We know it is not onerous. We know they can 
afford it. We know they need to be doing something like this. The 
money is not going anywhere else. 

With respect to the FHA funds, because of what has been identified, 
again, new money, not presently allocated for any other purpose, 
I think this is just a great way to fund a housing trust fund 
which the country needs and has needed for a long time. ",15

the Congressional Record, a quote, ‘‘If we in Congress had not succumbed 
to the administration’s efforts to slash, cut and terminate 
our assisted housing programs many of the people on our streets 
today would not be there.’’ 

This might well have been plucked randomly from most of the 
homelessness and housing hearings over the past 7 years. In fact, 
it is a quote from the late Housing Subcommittee and later full 
committee chair, Henry Gonzales, rising on the House Floor on 
March 5, 1987, to speak in support of the bill that would become 
the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. ",15
GSE hearing.txt," The GSEs are not a regulator. They are an investor 
in mortgages. And the real answer, I mean, to the question that 
you have asked, is that the GSEs had no supervision over the 
subprime lenders, even remotely, because they originated a class of 
product that the GSEs were not purchasing, I mean, other than in 
an—out of the marketplace, in a AAA strip. So, they really fell 
under, if you will, the radar screen, relative to regulation in that 
respect. ",15
HR1892 hearing.txt," the most important things that this Congress can do as 
we search for ways to help those who have been harmed by the 
subprime market is to give FHA the tools it needs to be a viable 
alternative for first time and lower income borrowers. That is why 
this hearing on FHA modernization is both timely and critical. By 
modernizing FHA we can provide another alternative for low-income 
borrowers who may otherwise be forced into higher cost 
subprime loans or even predatory products. By moving quickly to 
modernize FHA, we can provide a safe alternative for hundreds of 
thousands of lower income credit-worthy borrowers looking to either 
purchase a new home or avoid foreclosure. ",16
GSE hearing.txt," the regulator must have a funding stream, separate 
and apart from the annual appropriations process. In order to be 
credible and effective, the regulator must additionally have genuine 
independence from the political system. Such independence must 
consist of complete autonomy from the enterprises, include sufficient 
protection from outside special interests, and provide for substantial 
insulation from political interference. 

A strong regulator must further have robust supervisory and enforcement 
powers. In this regard, many have suggested that we 
should model GSEs safety and soundness regulation on that of 
other financial institutions. I agree with this sensible concept. 

In fact, the general goal of our longstanding regulatory reform

NHTF Hearing.txt," We can see from local housing trust funds that the 
concept works. There are over 600 local or State housing trust 
funds today. In big cities, such as New York City, the effort is underway 
to try to create or preserve 4,300 units with a trust fund. 
In Chicago, the goal is 5,500 rental subsidized units, not over 30 
percent of median income, to meet the city-wide goal of producing 
affordable housing. 

In smaller communities, many that are in high-cost areas, such 
as Boulder, Colorado, the explicit goal of the City is to use a housing 
trust fund to make sure that 10 percent of the housing stock 
is permanently affordable. In Boulder, that amounts to 2,700 units 
of which 2,100 would be rental, and 600 would be ownership. 

In another high-cost area, Mountain View, California, they are 
using the housing trust fund of Santa Clara County there where 
Catholic Charities just produced an award winning single room occupancy 
facility for people earning between $15,000 and $30,000 a 
year. That is 20 percent of average median income, using the flexibility 
that only a housing trust fund makes possible. 

At the State level, Washington State is considered as one of the 
most effective State housing trust funds. They have over the years 
amassed $500 million and leveraged $2 billion in 32,000 units, 
mostly rental. ",15

I must say that I strongly believe that we must ensure that this

I share Mr. Baker’s concerns, as he has expressed over the years,

transparencies. I also share the concerns that I expressed last year, 
when we passed the legislation out of this committee, with regard 
to the housing fund, and how that would have a negative impact 
upon the housing marketplace. And in light of the subprime market’s 
concerns, I am wondering how that will all flesh out, as well, 
whether what we may be doing here today is exacerbating that 
problem. 

As we only saw this bill drop in—as Mr. Renzi indicated—on Friday, 
I am still in the process of reviewing it, as well. I am pleased 
to see that there may be some additional safeguards, with regard 
to the portfolio limitations, something that Treasury, I know, was 
looking for, and I was, as well. So I will be looking forward to the 
panel’s discussion on those ends, as well. ",16

I think the key to eliminating the concentrations of poverty that 
you see, and creating a vibrant community, is to be able to take 
the funds that are targeted at those very-low-income households 
making 30 percent of median or less, and use those in developments 
that also have the first-time home buyers and the market 
rate condominiums, and use the pieces of the tool that are allowed, 
given its flexibility in the Trust Fund Act, for the moderate-income 
component as well—the downpayment assistance, construction 
costs. 

I mean, it is all the same development, and you can use that 
money for construction costs, for acquisition, for downpayment assistance, 
and for closing cost assistance. So I think there is a lot 
of attention still in the bill to helping that moderate-income group, 
but it does it in a way that you can integrate it with the very-lowincome 
as well. ",15

It would just seem to me that what I am trying to do is create 
the availability of community and economic development funds on 
a rather uniform basis with a relative cost that is similar, regardless 
of the size of the entity, or population of the entity making the 
loan. The reason for this is so that we can get the marketplace to 
really function well, that you don’t have to start sitting down with

your business in order to qualify for what type of loan, or what

Mr. LYNCH. But, Mr. Connelly, that would necessitate—well, it 
would be in conflict with the idea that the regulator should not be 
active in the prime mortgage market in a way—the—some of the 
failings of these mortgages in the subprime market are happening 
in the origination process, where you have people who shouldn’t be 
getting loans but are, in fact, getting them. 

It deals with the new program issue about new programs coming 
out, and you’re going to have a regulator back here, saying, ‘‘No, 
that’s not an approved product,’’ so it’s going to affect some things

last year and through the House, this year though since October 
of last year we have been doing home buying counseling, 
working with many nonprofit groups trying to get the word out, 
working with Realtors to help many families. But while we are

way to do it is to pass this bill to help more. ",16

funds work well—some would say they refer to them as sort of benign 
revenue sources, but that’s the coin of the realm of making 
trust funds work. States use document recording fees. They use 
real estate transfer taxes. They use interest from escrow accounts 
that have been returned to a State entity. That’s a big jump from 
now taking on a Federal level, the possibility of taking funds out 
of a housing agency to go fund a housing trust fund.

the benefits, although with greatly increased regulation, but we use 
some of that money for good public purpose. Similarly with the 
FHA, our bill, contrary to suggestions that it’s going to lead to FHA 
fee increases, in the bill that our committee passed we seek to prevent 
the Bush Administration from increasing FHA fees not because 
there is a need to do that to do FHA business but to help 
benefit the general Treasury. 

And section 30 of the bill would prohibit HUD from increasing 
any FHA premium above the level that was in effect at the beginning 
of this fiscal year unless the Secretary shows that in the absence 
of an increase the program would require a subsidy from the 
Congress. So we, in fact, strengthen the resistance to FHA fee increases, 
and that applies to what we’re doing here. 

If anything in this legislation that we have passed on the FHA 
that would get incorporated here were to cause a fee increase that 
would kick in. So we in fact prohibit fee increases. In fact our bill 
says no money goes to the housing fund if it were threatened, a fee 
increase. So the truth is that the bill that we passed already on the 
FHA, and it’s all part of one package conceptually, prevents a fee

And I will say, and I don’t ask for any comment on this, that my 
sense is that the desire for this fee increase did not come from the 
FHA and that it did not come from HUD, but it came from OMB. 
That is to be the FHA’s contribution to the war in Iraq. And we 
make it very clear that the FHA fee should increase only if there 
was a need to do that for FHA business. ",15
NHTF Hearing.txt,"Another aspect of the bill that I think is excellent is the local 
flexibility. From my experience working in Boston with the Boston 
Public Health Commission, local community development corporations, 
and some State-funded housing developments, the ability for 
State or local governments to match the best local solution to the 
greatest housing needs makes the most sense. 

In some instances, rental housing needs are the most pressing. 
In others, home ownership may be the best outcome. And research 
has consistently shown that home ownership makes housing more 
stable and is better for overall health. In pediatrics, the best therapies 
are often tailored, and this bill clearly accommodates that. I 
urge you to support H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing 
Trust Fund bill, because it can ensure that our most vulnerable 
population, our children, have safe, decent, and affordable homes. ",15

more funding for our State housing trust fund back then. 

I am fearful that some State housing finance agencies with a

figure it out, so to speak. I think some States would go full speed 
ahead and spend it and hope for the best, relative to the compliance

that is among our insured financial institutions, for meeting their 
tier one capital requirements, about 70 percent or more of those institutions 
now meet those capital requirements by holding GSE securities. 
I was told by an FDIC person some time ago not to worry, 
that was really broad GSE debt. So I took great comfort in the fact 
that must have meant Farmer Mac. So I knew I wasn’t worried,

GSE hearing.txt,"As you approach the legislation here today, it is important to ask 
why the Home Loan Banks are so important to the Nation’s economy, 
and why it is so important to ensure that the new regulatory 
structure enable, and not impede, our mission achievement. 

Member institutions use the Home Loan Banks’ loans—we call 
them advances—to meet the housing community and economic development 
lending needs in their local markets. Home Loan Bank 
advances are, in fact, the only capital market access for many 
Home Loan Bank members. 

The Home Loan Banks’ mortgage purchase programs also provide 
members, particularly smaller-sized institutions, a desirable 
secondary market alternative, and are a very important part of our 
mission to provide liquidity. These programs have allowed many of 
our smaller members to offer 30-year fixed rate mortgage products 
for the first time. 

The Home Loan Banks also represent the single largest private 
sector source of grants supporting low-income housing. Home Loan 
Bank members utilize the AHP, the affordable housing program, to 
help low-income families obtain housing, and have been awarded 
over $2.5 billion to create more than half-a-million—520,000—affordable 
housing units since 1990. 

A key strength of this affordable housing program is its flexibility 
to adapt to differing community needs across the country. 
Unlike some other programs, AHP funds can be used for both housing 
rehab and new construction, and can be used to augment other 
sources of funding, by filling in gaps. ",16

GSE hearing.txt,"Banking on Business, or BOB, as we call it, helps eligible small 
businesses with start-up and expansion costs. It is financing—this 
is a slice of financing that really enables a small business to be 
creditworthy for regular banking. Since 2000, more than $27.5 million 
in BOB funding in our Pittsburgh geography has created or retained 
over 3,800 jobs. 

Just simple examples of the businesses include: the Grace Dental 
Practice in Cabin Creek, West Virginia; Nazar Diesel, in Jessup, 
Pennsylvania, a diesel engine repair business; and many others 
like them. This year we will be putting into the pot some $7 million 
in new funds for these new small businesses. 

Then we have our community lending program, an $825 million 
revolving loan pool that offers loans to our member financial institutions 
for lending for community and economic development 
projects. A Pittsburgh member bank, for example, recently used 
CLP, community lending, to help three northeastern Pennsylvania—
does that have a certain ring to it—three northeastern 
Pennsylvania municipalities upgrade their public water and sewer 
systems with $8 million in flexible low-interest financing. 

Systemwide, the Home Loan Banks have used these programs to 
provide over $44 billion, financing over 600,000 housing units, and 
thousands of economic development projects throughout the country. 


In another take on economic and community development, working 
with the Governor of Pennsylvania and with the Brookings Institution, 
the Pittsburgh Bank developed something called ‘‘Blueprint 
Communities Program,’’ in cooperation with multiple partners. 
It’s a neighborhood revitalization initiative that was launched 
2 years ago. 

The program, at first, involved 22 urban and rural communities 
across Pennsylvania, and is expanding to Delaware next year. In 
West Virginia, the program was announced by Governor Joe 
Manchin this morning.

GSE hearing.txt,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are our partners in the real estate 
industry, so keeping them strong and sound is in everyone’s interest. 
With that in mind, Realtors have six recommendations that we 
believe should be considered in any legislative proposals to reform 
GSE oversight. 

First, the GSEs need a strong regulator and sound corporate governance. 
Regulatory oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 
Federal Home Loan Bank should be transferred to a new regulator 


8 


which has the authority to set capital standards, liquidate a financially 
unstable enterprise, and approve new programs and products. 
The regulators should also understand and support the GSEs’ 
vital housing finance mission and the role housing plays in supporting 
our national economy. 

Realtors also support legislative efforts to strengthen the governance 
of the Federal Home Loan Banks, by raising the number of 
independent directors, adding community and economic development 
expertise, and allowing appointed independent directors to 
continue their service until a successor is in place. 

Second, the GSEs’ vital housing mission should be preserved and 
protected. This mission ensures that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
provide capital to the market during downturns, and use their Federal 
ties to facilitate mortgage finance, and support homeownership 
opportunities. The GSEs’ housing mission is vital to the continued 
success of the housing market. Realtors will oppose legislative proposals 
which diminish that. 

Third, the GSEs must be able to develop new products and programs 
that respond to market needs. The standards for approving 
new products and programs should be those contained in the Federal 
National Mortgage Association Charter Act, and the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act. We support requiring the 
GSEs to provide notice to the regulator, so that adequate safety, 
soundness, and mission review can be accomplished. 

We oppose requirements that could unduly delay or prevent the 
GSEs from developing new programs and products that support 
their missions. 

Fourth, there should be no overly restrictive bright line test that 
explicitly limits the GSEs’ role in the secondary market, strictly defined. 
Realtors believe such a test would seriously hinder important 
mission-related consumer outreach activities now supported by the 
GSEs, such as home buyer education. 

Fifth, portfolio limits should be regulated, and not legislated. The 
GSEs’ retained portfolios help support affordable housing programs, 
and also help provide financing for low-income borrowers. 
For example, Freddie Mac reports that approximately 300 million 
of the mortgages in the retained portfolio qualify under their affordable 
housing goals. We believe the best way to ensure safety is 
for a strong regulator to limit portfolio risk, and moderate portfolio 
growth, when appropriate. 

Finally, Realtors support increasing the conforming loan limits 
for high-cost areas, and we would like to thank Chairman Frank 
and Representative Miller for their support on this important 
issue, and for including the Miller amendment language in H.R. 
1427. ",15

hard for extremely-low-income Americans. Unfortunately, a 
disproportionate number of these people are African Americans and 
other racial and ethnic minorities. 

Currently only 46 percent of African Americans own their own 
homes, compared to more than 70 percent of white Americans. Perhaps 
more troubling than that statistic, however, is the disparate 
number of African Americans who spend too much of their income, 
which is already at the low end of the wage scale, on housing and 
utilities. 

The most current numbers we have indicate that 23 percent of 
African Americans fall into the extremely-low-income category. 
These men, women, children, and families have severe housing 
needs. In other words, they spend more than 50 percent of their income 
of housing and utilities.

In summary, half of all African Americans live in unaffordable, 
inadequate, and/or crowded housing. But of course, this is not only 
a problem for African Americans. Seventy-one percent of Hispanic 
Americans who fall into the extremely-low-income category have 
severe housing needs, and 66 percent of extremely-low-income Caucasians 
pay more than 50 percent of their income to ensure they 
have a roof over their heads. All these numbers add up to one 
alarming fact: Too many Americans of all races and ethnic backgrounds 
are too often forced to choose between shelter over their 
heads or food on their tables. 

If these numbers do not convince you of the clear need for a National 
Affordable Housing Trust Fund as established in this bill, let 
me also tell you that the situation is getting worse. In 2003, the 

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated 
that there was a deficit of two million extremely-low-income rental 
units. In 2005, that deficit had grown to four million. 
In 2003, HUD estimated that there were 44 affordable rental 
units available for every 100 extremely-low-income families. That 
number dropped to 40 units available in 2005, and the number continues 
to worsen. 

Unfortunately, the number of extremely-low-income households 
continues to grow as the number of affordable rental units decreases.

CHRG-108hhrg88663.htm,"H.R. 1841, the Housing Assistance to Needy 
Families legislation, would convert the Section 8 voucher 
program to a block grant, transferring its administration to 
the 50 States, and giving them discretion over allocation of 
funds, directly or indirectly.
    Section 8 supports over 4 million apartments. Roughly 1 in 
7 renters nationwide benefit from some form of Section 8 
assistance. Of the 4 million Section 8 households, about 35 
percent, or 1.4 million, have portable vouchers. The HANF 
proposal would fundamentally change the Federal funding system 
for tenant based housing assistance, from one based on actual 
cost to a block grant that simply distributes Federal 
appropriations among States.
    With the passage of HUD's funding year 2003 budget, block 
granting the program to States for this reason is unnecessary 
as the problem of under utilized vouchers has already been 
addressed. If funding levels fall behind the program's needs, 
as likely will occur, States will either have to contribute 
their own funds to the program or reduce assistance to low 
income families and elderly and disabled individuals.

16 percent of the Nation's leased vouchers. I am concerned that 
assistance to families currently participating in California's 
Section 8 programs would be jeopardized under the new proposal.
    Under the current Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program

per year is approximately $8,364. The funding shortfall for

problem. 

It is precisely the type of development that could have been funded

If there were more Federal funds available, it would have meant 
a quicker development process and ultimately more public benefit. 

Our St. John of God & St. Jean Baptiste developments, also in 
Massachusetts, are very similar. They could have used this trust 
fund enormously. 

Finally, the Saint Aidan, which is a 59 unit mixed-income development

way, the median family house price for a single family home last

greater obligation not to discriminate. This proposal turns 
that on its head. People who receive Federal funds as we have

we did last year, to have the maximum flexibility. And that is one

precipitously. Lenders have progressed, reacting to quickly changing

mortgage markets have boomed. Many of these loans offer 
low teaser rates which reset to much higher rates after a few years. 
In many cases, these borrowers qualified only on their ability to 
make the initial payment and face large prepayment penalties if

But this, in particular, this is the most anti-bureaucratic program

than a standard Federal bureaucracy and it can be done using very 
entrepreneurial kind of private sector models and done very 
straightforwardly. 

The HOME program is not deep enough. It does not get to the 
30 percent in the way it is operated in most communities. It is not 
operative in that way.

NHTF Hearing.txt,"Madam Chairwoman. Madam Chairwoman, 
I must again express my adamant opposition to this legislation 
and the idea here of creating what is called the Affordable 
Housing Fund. As I have expressed since its inception, this fund 
is straight out of Central Planning 101. This is really a step in the 
wrong direction. 

There appears here to be a clear conflict of vision. I think past 
government housing programs have actually done very little, if you 
look at the record, to increase homeownership levels in this country. 
We do not have much to show for the tens of billions of dollars 
we spent on housing through HUD and FHA, but there is a way 
to improve homeownership rates. 

They improve when real interest rates are low and when consumer 
incomes are high. Under that kind of an environment people 
can afford to frankly get into a position where they can buy their 
own home. I believe limited government and free market policies 
will generate these results; creeping socialism will not. It will work 
more as an anchor on the economy and prosperity. It will keep the 
private sector from becoming as vibrant and creating the opportunities 
for people so that they can move up. 

This fund will waste resources. It’s going to provide false hope 
for those who wish to increase homeownership. Additionally this 
fund will create a terrible precedent, a terrible, terrible precedent 
for other industries in this country. As I said during the GSE and

FHA debates, I hope that other financial institutions are watching 
this debate because you’re going to be the next targets. 

Proponents of this concept are not going to stop at just assessing 
or taxing GSEs and the Federal Housing Administration. They’re 
going to try to confiscate money once they set up this fund from 
any source they can get it. ",16

CHRG-108hhrg89932.htm,"many of us were alarmed when we learned that the Administration 
was not desirous of reauthorizing HOPE VI. As you know, we all 
have concerns about public housing--the funding for public 
housing, section 8, making more units available, rehab--all of 
that. But HOPE VI has taken on quite a significant meaning for 
distressed housing in this country. While the Administration 
makes the argument that not all of the dollars allocated to 
HOPE VI have been spent, our examination of this issue does not 
lead us to conclude that this is a good reason why HOPE VI 
should not be reauthorized.
    We have learned that the number of applications for it 
outweigh any concerns about whether it is needed. As a matter 
of fact, we believe that if we simply fund it at about 50 
percent of those applications that have been put in, we would 
be going a long way toward providing safe affordable housing 
for so many of our citizens who are in desperate need. Not only 
are we concerned about the lack of reauthorization, we think 
this sends a message. We do not know why, even if you did not 
want to put the dollars into it, if the Administration did not 
want to put the dollars into it, we do not know why you would 
not simply support reauthorization. That is a signal that says, 
we think this program has value. We think that despite the fact 
that all of the dollars have not been spent, we do see progress 
being made.
    We have discovered in our examination of the issue that 
increasingly the housing authorities have reduced the number of 
days that it has taken them to get up to speed, and we think it 
gets even better. We think with the more involvement of the 
private sector and all of that, that these grants can be 
expedited in ways that can put the rehabilitation of housing 
units on line in ways, again, that would make them available to 
people who so desperately need it.

the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future 
generations bearing much of the cost. He said that at a House

    Recently Controller General Walker of GAO said that the 
rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that 
threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could 
bankrupt America. Most of the models I have seen from OMB and 
CBO and others, who slice and dice the numbers here, have us on 
a collision course over the next several decades of either 
having a Federal Government consisting of a little more than

are in a situation where the hands of Caesar are carrying

Vouchers can only be used to support home mortgages to the

Housing Assistance for Needy Families Act. NNCSHA neither

deserves Congress' full consideration. NNCSHA supports a 
voucher block grant in concept. However, we have taken a 
neutral stance on the administration's plan because of our 
serious concerns about the adequacy of the program funding and 
flexibility it proposes.
    Section 8 vouchers are one of our most important affordable 
housing tools, but the voucher program is not meeting its 
potential. Its complex rules and regulations block innovation, 
drive up costs, discourage private sector involvement, and 
confuse customers and administrators.
    The decentralization of funding to more than 2,500 PHAs 
complicates program administration, increases costs, prevents 
maximum utilization of funds and frustrates regional and 
statewide housing strategies. If implemented with sufficient 
funding and flexibility, HANF could resolve many of the current 
program's problems and create new opportunities for voucher 
use.
    States have the capacity to administer the voucher program. 
States possess a multi-decade record of responsibility, 
effectiveness, and accountability in administering tens of 
billions of dollars in housing assistance. They possess 
statewide sophisticated financial asset management and 
administrative oversight capability. Many States already 
administer Section 8.
    States are uniquely positioned to administer Federal 
housing resources. They understand local housing needs and 
markets, while bringing a State and regional perspective to 
problems that cannot be solved within municipal boundaries. 
States can ensure housing funding is applied where it is most 
needed and integrated with other public investments in their 
communities.
    Moreover, States have the ability to bring together State 
agencies and resources. State agencies are partners, for 
example, with welfare agencies to coordinate TANF funds with 
housing assistance. The voucher program, adequately funded and 
rationally regulated, would benefit from State administration.
    States' knowledge of local housing markets, access to other 
housing and nonhousing resources, ability to respond to 
changing local circumstances and prioritizing needs across 
States would overcome many of the voucher program's current 
limitations.
    Federal oversight would be more efficiently concentrated on 
50 entities. However, HANF must not be an underfunded mandate. 
We urge Congress to safeguard vouchers and the low income 
families who depend on them by authorizing mandatory voucher 
spending in an amount at least adequate to finance all 
currently authorized vouchers. Authorizing legislation must 
also specify that funds would be adjusted annually to cover 
cost increases.
    To work HANF must be a flexible program. It must be free 
from unnecessary and burdensome Federal requirements. HUD 
regulation must be limited to that necessary to assure 
nondiscrimination and accountability for the use of funds to 
achieve goals Congress sets. Performance standards must not 
compel States to respond to Federal priorities rather than 
their own.

assist you in that effort.",15

CHRG-108hhrg93838.htm,"One year ago Freddie Mac first revealed that it would delay 
the release of the 2002 accounting reports pending the 
completion of a restatement of its financial records for 
earlier years. This announcement raised considerable concerns 
for those who monitor GSEs. It also began a period of intense 
scrutiny of the company by its regulators, lawmakers and the 
press.
    Six months later, Freddie Mac's Board announced an 
unexpected management shakeup. This change in corporate 
leadership produced even greater concerns among those with 
knowledge of GSEs. For example, I observed that government-
sponsored enterprises with public responsibilities and private 
capital have a special obligation to operate fairly, safely, 
and soundly. I believe and I continue to believe that today. 
The management of these entities must ensure that they produce 
accounting statements that reflect their real financial 
conditions.
    At the time I also said that Freddie Mac must maintain 
sufficient capital reserves, adopt prudent management reforms, 
expedite completion of its earnings restatements, and employ 
appropriate accounting techniques to prevent similar problems 
in the future. I suspect that, before we complete today's 
hearing, we will discuss each of these issues in great depth. 
We have a responsibility to study these matters and ensure that 
the company follows its statutory mandate to operate in a safe 
and sound manner.
    Additionally, the financial reporting problems by Freddie 
Mac renewed efforts by some to modify GSE regulation. As I said 
at our very first hearing on oversight of government-sponsored 
enterprises in March of 2000, we need to have strong 
independent regulators that have the resources they need to get 
the job done. I continue to support strong GSE regulation. A 
strong regulator will protect the continued validity of our 
capital markets and promote confidence in Freddie Mac and 
Fannie Mae. It will also ensure taxpayers against systemic risk 
and expand opportunities for all Americans.
    Today more than 68 percent of Americans own the homes in 
which they live. Government-sponsored enterprises have 
contributed greatly to this accomplishment. Because our housing 
marketplace is one of the most important sectors in our 
persistently struggling economy, we must also tread carefully

justification for rewriting the GSEs’ housing mission, or weakening 
the housing finance system. ",15
HR1892 hearing.txt,"Realtors support efforts to give consumers affordable alternatives 
to the more risky loans that are currently being heavily marketed. 
We believe the FHA could again be a viable, affordable alternative 
for borrowers with less than ideal credit. 

Today, we ask you to advance legislation that would reform the 
FHA Mortgage Insurance Program in several important ways. Increases 
in FHA loan limits are needed not just in high-cost areas, 
but nationwide. Such increases are critical for FHA to assist home 
buyers in places like California but also areas where home prices 
exceed the current maximum limit but are not defined as high cost, 
such as Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona. 

Second, we ask you to eliminate the statutory 3 percent minimum 
down payment on FHA-insured mortgages. In 2005, 43 percent 
of first-time home buyers financed 100 percent of their home. 
NAR research indicates that if FHA were allowed to offer this option, 
1.6 million families could benefit, including many low-income 
and minority home buyers. Eliminating the statutory 3 percent 
minimum cash investment will provide consumers a safe option 
away from non-traditional products. 

Third, NAR supports legislation that would provide FHA with 
the ability to charge borrowers different premiums based on risks 
of the borrowers and type of loan product. Currently, all FHA borrowers, 
regardless of risk, pay virtually the same premiums and receive 
the same interest rate. Giving FHA the flexibility to charge 
different borrowers different premiums based on risk will allow 
FHA to increase their pool of borrowers. Risk-based pricing makes 
sense in the private market and does for FHA as well. 

Fourth, NAR supports moving the Condo Program into the 203(b) 
Program and combining all single family programs into the Mutual 
Mortgage Insurance Fund. From a conceptual and accounting 
standpoint, it makes sound business sense to place all single family 
programs under the MMIF. We also recommend that HUD lift 
many of the barriers that make condominium purchase difficult 
under FHA. We believe the current policies limit sales and home

GSE hearing.txt,"Regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank system can be improved 
within the framework of a single consolidated GSE regulator, 
but only if adequate safeguards are provided to recognize and 
maintain the unique cooperative characteristics of the system. 

Community banks have a rich history of superior performance in 
lending to minority and low-income borrowers, as well as first-time 
homebuyers. The affordable housing program of the Federal Home 
Loan Banks supports this business with advances and programs. 
These activities would not be possible without access to advances. 
The creation and availability of the Federal Home Loan Bank products, 
such as advances, are critical to the Federal Home Loan Bank 
system’s ability to evolve and meet the specific needs of our communities. 


We believe that any meaningful reform legislation must create a 
new, independent regulator with the authority to strictly prevent 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from entering the primary market. 
It must also possess the regulatory and supervisory authorities 


11 


equivalent to that of the Federal banking regulators, including the 
authority to adjust portfolio holdings and capital requirements for 
safety and soundness. 

The independence of the Federal regulator is also a crucial element. 
A structure that provides autonomy from the congressional 
appropriation process is essential. Most importantly, the unique cooperative 
structure of the Federal Home Loan Banks must be preserved. 


The finance board has powers and authorities similar to those of 
the banking regulators in the areas of capital, activities, and supervision. 
They, too, should be preserved. The success of the Federal 
Home Loan Bank affordable housing programs suggest certain 
characteristics that should be fostered in similar programs that are 
proposed for other GSEs. 

America’s Community Bankers strongly recommends that any 
newly established AHPs draw heavily from the experiences of the 
Federal Home Loan Banks. The design should include private sector 
lenders, and developers with public and not-for-profit partners, 
both at the proposal stage and in project management. 

We believe that the composition of the boards of each of the Federal 
Home Loan Banks is a vital mechanism to ensure that the 
governance of the banks is undertaken in an appropriate manner. 
Recently, the finance board passed a rule to address the growing 
number of vacancies on the Federal Home Loan Bank boards in the 
public interest director category. The rule called for Federal Home 
Loan Banks to provide two candidates for each public interest director 
vacancy on the board. 

It is our preference that the boards be populated through an election, 
rather than an appointment process. There is no regulator 
who knows the strengths and weaknesses of the boards better than 
the Banks themselves. Even the current chairman of the finance 
board agrees, and has stated repeatedly that the regulator should 
not be in the position to appoint the regulated. ",15

CHRG-108hhrg88663.htm,"The HANF proposal would fundamentally 
change the Federal funding systems for tenant-based housing 
assistance from one based on actual cost to a block grant that 
simply distributes Federal appropriations among States. One of 
the Stated goals of the administration for HANF is to improve 
the under utilization of the Section 8 program. However, with 
the recent passage of HUD's funding year 2003 budget, block 
granting the program to States for this reason is unnecessary, 
as the problem of under utilized vouchers has already been 
addressed. The budget provides only enough funds to ensure that 
every family currently assisted under the program will continue 
to be assisted, rather than continuing the policy of funding 
all vouchers, even if they are not being used.
    Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Kit 
Bond, in a Statement at a March 6, 2003 subcommittee hearing, 
said, and I quote, in my opinion, HANF is premature. The VA-HUD 
funding 2003 appropriations bill created a new funding 
structure for Section 8. Vouchers where public housing 
authorities receive the funding for all vouchers in use and for 
any vouchers that can be used up to a PHAs authorized level. 
This funding approach should result in a more realistic 
assessment of Section 8 funding needs, and reduce the need to 
go through the annual ritual of rescinding large amounts of 
unused excess Section 8 assistance. I think it will take 
several years to ensure the reliability of this new funding 
system, but I am optimistic that will become a good gauge of 
both the actual cost and the use of vouchers.
    A January, 2002 GAO report compared the six active Federal 
housing programs and found that Section 8 vouchers were the 
most cost-effective. Historically, funding for block grants 
such as HANF has failed to keep pace with inflation. Under 
HANF, funding levels would be based on inflation-adjusted 
figures, as opposed to current policy which bases renewal 
funding on actual housing costs. Between 1998 and 2003, rents 
rose by 25 percent. Over the same period of time, the consumer 
price index increased by 12 percent. Even at inflation-adjusted 
levels as suggested by the administration, housing assistance 
is likely to erode steadily under HANF.
    If funding levels fall behind the program's needs, as 
likely will occur, States will either have to contribute their 
own funds to the program or reduce assistance to low-income 
families and elderly and disabled individuals in one or more of 
the following ways: reduction of the number of families that 
receive housing vouchers, despite the fact that three out of 
four low-income families eligible for vouchers already go 
without assistance because of funding limitations. A reduction 
in the number of vouchers would make the shortage of affordable 
housing even larger by cutting costs, by shifting assistance to 
higher-income families. Such families need smaller subsidies to 
be able to afford housing. As a result, the average cost of 
providing housing vouchers to these families is smaller than 
the cost of serving poor families. Also cutting costs by 
shifting rental burdens to families participating in the 
program. This can be accomplished by requiring families to pay 
more than 30 percent of their income for rent, or reducing the 
total amount of rent that a voucher could cover, thereby making 
fewer housing units accessible to voucher families.
    There is a lot more here, but I think that which I have 
shared with you basically describes my concerns about HANF. I 
am very, very worried about this program, Mr. Chairman. This is 
one of the most significant programs to assist poor people that 
we have in this country. I come from a State where we have a 
$35 billion deficit. If you block grant that money to my state, 
they are going to take some of it and use it for other things. 
Or if they needed to subsidize it in any way, they could not do 
it because we just do not have the money.",15

regulatory system, like the bill we passed in the 109th Congress,

For example, the regulator must have a funding stream, separate 
and apart from the annual appropriations process. In order to be 
credible and effective, the regulator must additionally have genuine 
independence from the political system. Such independence must 
consist of complete autonomy from the enterprises, include sufficient

insulation from political interference. 

A strong regulator must further have robust supervisory and enforcement

should model GSEs safety and soundness regulation on that of 
other financial institutions. I agree with this sensible concept. 

In fact, the general goal of our longstanding regulatory reform 
debates has been to make GSE supervision more bank-like. Any 
safety and soundness regulator for the housing GSEs needs to have 
enforcement powers on par with other Federal banking regulators. 
As we proceed in the coming weeks, I also hope that we will continue

In addition to affordable loans, Latino families benefit from

communities across the country. Last year, we helped nearly 3,000

one of the most important factors in their ability to successfully 
purchase. Research also shows that these families are far less likely 
to default. H.R. 1852 increases the availability of counseling for 
FHA borrowers. This is especially important for borrowers who 
would access the newer products such as zero down payment and 
interest-only loans.

In smaller communities, many that are in high-cost areas, such

The goal of the national housing trust fund and H.R. 2895 is to

a very ambitious goal. 

The bill provides dedicated sources of funding. CBO estimates 
that the combined value of these would be no more than $1 billion 
a year, which is quite substantial, but to reach our goal, we are 
going to have to find other dedicated sources of revenue and the

they have been used to support such non-housing related issues as 
the war in Iraq, nuclear testing, or anything else the Federal Government 
does. This notion that money should not come from the 
FHA for other purposes is a very new one because the FHA has 
been a money maker for the rest of the Federal Government in the 
past. Now it is true that many of us—including the gentlewoman 
from California and I—believe that if the FHA continues to generate 
surpluses, and we certainly will guarantee that first claim on 
any monies goes to keep the FHA functioning, but the question is 
should the surpluses go into the general treasury and help offset

the war in Iraq, bridges to nowhere, and all of those other

NHTF Hearing.txt,"While I commend this committee’s goal of increasing the amount 
of available, affordable housing, I do not believe that H.R. 2895 is 
an efficient means to achieve it. And I’ll make three quick points 
to expand on this. First, because the trust fund is financed through 
self-defeating provisions in both the GSE reform bill and the FHA 
reauthorization bill, low- and middle-income Americans, including 
the elderly, will have to foot the bill. 

Specifically, it’s estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
two entities that purchased or securitized almost 80 percent of 
American families’ mortgages, will be taxed more than $3 billion 
over a 5-year period to help pay for the trust fund. As publicly 
traded companies accountable to their shareholders, Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac will inevitably seek to pass along these new assessments 
to their customers, America’s low- and middle-income 
homeowners. 

This is unacceptable and will result in what amounts to a mortgage 
tax on these hardworking low- and middle-income Americans 
seeking to secure, maintain, or refinance their home mortgages. To 
me, it’s robbing Peter to save Paul. 

And then second, CBO has estimated that FHA reauthorization 
bill could result in a $370 million surplus in 2008 and a $2.1 billion 
surplus over the 2008 to 2012 period. Now normally we would say 
that the surplus is a good thing, but not in this case. In this case 
the surplus would come through overcharging seniors on their reverse 
mortgages, and I don’t think that’s right. 


7 


By far the majority of this FHA surplus would come from reverse 
mortgages premiums paid by our seniors, suggesting that they 
have been overcharged. As you know I have supported the ideas 
aimed at giving the surplus back to our seniors in the form of reduced 
premiums, which this committee rejected. By using the reverse 
mortgage product as a moneymaker to finance a National 
Housing Trust Fund, this bill instead instructs FHA to continue 
overcharging and essentially taxing our seniors. Our seniors deserve 
better. 

At the same time, this bill removes all surplus funds out of FHA, 
which I believe threatens the solvency of the FHA fund and its 
ability to pay out on insurance claims. 

Third, a National Housing Trust Fund unnecessarily adds another 
Federal housing program to the over 100 programs that already 
exist. The National Low Income Housing Coalition cites 
nearly 600 housing trust funds that have been created in cities, 
counties, and States of this country generating more than $1.6 billion 
per year to support housing needs. 

For example, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund in Illinois allocates 
approximately $16 million to $20 million each year to benefit 
low- and very-low-income households. Additionally, the Illinois 
Rental Housing Support Program provides rent subsidies for an estimated 
4,000 rent burdened households. 

I think that these regionally tailored programs work best because 
they allow funds to be tailored to localized housing and community 
development needs. Also, to the extent that Federal programs fall 
short in some way, I must point out the existing federally administered 
program designed to serve the housing needs of low-income 
Americans, the Home Investment Partnership Program. This program 
already has the personnel, systems, and regulatory oversight 
in place to accomplish the same objectives as the National Housing 
Trust Fund. 

Rather than create a new Federal bureaucracy to address low-income 
housing availability, we should instead focus our efforts on 
improving the HOME program. ",16
