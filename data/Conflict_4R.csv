NHTF Hearing.txt," am also here today to share new evidence that shows that 
housing is the foundation to excellent child health. I hope to convince 
you that the best medical intervention for children is often 
finding them an affordable home, and it is within your power to 
keep kids healthy through housing. 

As many of you know, there are millions of families on affordable 
housing waiting lists. And in Boston, it is not unusual for waiting 
lists to actually close because there are so many families who are 
waiting and therefore they can’t even apply. Even families in homeless 
shelters are often there for over a year-and-a-half before they 
can get a home that they can afford. And often families who are 
on the waiting lists are forced to make terrible choices between 
rent and food, or settling on a home with severe housing problems 
like infestations or mold or lead paint because simply that is all 
that they can afford. 

We know from the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, 
which is commonly known as CSNAP, that food-insecure 
children who are eligible but don’t receive housing subsidies are 
twice as likely as those who do receive housing subsidies to have 
stunted growth by WHO criteria. It is an important aspect of this 
bill because it targets the lowest income families, the ones that are 
most likely to have food-insecure children, and that by giving them 
an affordable home, you may be able to prevent stunting from occurring. 


As you know, stunting not only limits children’s physical growth 
in the short term, but it stunts their lifelong potential because we 
know that if your body is not growing, your mind is not growing 
as well. 

Because many families have very limited choices of homes that 
they can afford and have to make tradeoffs, they often live in substandard 
conditions. For instance, I think that the cockroach infestation 
is an excellent example of how that affects health. We know 
that children who have asthma who are exposed to cockroaches in 
their home and are allergic are 3 times more likely to end up in 
the hospital. 

It is also known that 30 percent of children who live in the urban 
areas are allergic, but it may be surprising to note that 20 percent 
of suburban children are also exposed and are allergic to cockroaches. 
And further, new data suggests that exposure to cockroaches 
in early life may actually cause immune system changes 
that can lead to the development of wheezing or asthma. 

Young children who live with other substandard exposures, such 
as lead paint from older homes, can also lead to problems with development, 
and recent estimates have estimated that this leads to 
billions of dollars in education and other costs. 

Lastly, families who have difficulty affording rent may double up 
with other families, resulting in crowding, or these families may

frequently move. We know children who stay in the same home 
and do not more frequently have better child development outcomes 
and do better in school. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt," And since we have 
enacted pro-growth tax policies in 2003, we have had 8.2 million 
new jobs created. And yet many in this House and many on the 
committee want the tax relief to go away. And, as you take away 
the tax relief, you begin to take away the jobs. 

Secondly, if we truly care about affordable housing, we need to 
realize how the single largest tax increase in American history contained 
within the Democrat budget resolution, how that impacts 
families who are trying to make their homes affordable. 

I hear from constituents in my district. I hear from the Brucker 
Family in Wills Point who writes, ‘‘No increase in taxes. My family 
is only one breath away from losing our home as it is.’’ 

I hear from the Stevens Family in Forney, Texas, ‘‘If our taxes 
increased $2,755, we would not be able to pay our mortgage.’’ And 
the list goes on and on and on. We need to realize that more spending 
fuels more taxes which makes homes less affordable. 

Third, it seems ironic to me that we would increase taxes on 
some, make housing less affordable for many low- and middle-income 
Americans because we know that Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac are an effectively a government protected duopoly. They have 
great economic power to simply pass along these fees or taxes, if 
you will, ultimately to the consumer. And so this is a mortgage tax, 
pure and simple. ",33

the way, that pool of borrowers that we have profiles that we can 
look at is some 4.5 million or so different risk profiles. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt," FHA premiums to provide money for the affordable housing 
fund, but you’re wanting the 17.5 percent increase on the multifamily, 
which is increasing it, and yet every year FHA makes a 
profit and it goes to the Treasury basically. 

I guess one problem I have is—I’m not arguing but I have a real 
problem with the comment you made on the downpayment assistance 
program that it’s very risky, and that’s the private sector 
helping with downpayment assistance for an individual. Yet the 
American Dream Downpayment Assistance Act, which is the government 
giving people for a downpayment is good. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt," HUD’s own worst case housing needs analysis 
shows that the number of low-income—and many of the families 
who will be targeted by this fund, the number of families who need 
that sort of assistance has gone up. 

Sadly that has gone up by 800,000 families between 2003 and 
2005. It’s one of the reasons why we have proposed as part of our 
2008 budget a demonstration program at least in the case of low-
income seniors and persons with disabilities, the way that we can 
leverage our limited resources through tax credits and private ac

tivity bonds to use those funds, to spread them out perhaps as 
bridge funds so HUD is not the only funding source impossible. 

One of the areas that again is of most concern to me is housing 
for seniors and for persons with disabilities, and I do share in that 
goal of what the fund would try to do, and that is to help more 
families at the extremely-low-income figure, at 30 percent and 
below. ",33
HR1892 hearing.txt," In 2006—is that better—1.2 million families entered 
into foreclosure, 42 percent more than in 2005. Predatory 
lending, exotic mortgages, and a dramatic rise in subprime lend-
ing,coupled with slowing home price appreciation have all contributed 
to this crisis. When the Federal Housing Administration was 
established back in 1934, consumers faced a similar lending crisis. 
At that time, FHA was an innovator and led the private market 
in offering safe, affordable home loans to American families. Since 
its inception, FHA has insured more than 34 million properties. 
However, the FHA has failed to keep pace with borrower needs and 
changes in the private market and is no longer a viable alternative 
for many borrowers. At the same time, the subprime and non-traditional 
mortgage markets have boomed. Many of these loans offer 
low teaser rates which reset to much higher rates after a few years. 
In many cases, these borrowers qualified only on their ability to 
make the initial payment and face large prepayment penalties if 
they attempt to refinance. Mortgage experts estimate that approximately 
$1.5 trillion worth of adjustable mortgages will reset by the 
end of 2007. Faced with significantly higher monthly payments, 
many borrowers will face the possibility of losing their homes. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt," in Alexandria, we have 
had a housing trust fund since 1993. Primarily, it was funded by 
developer voluntary contributions and then a few years ago, we 
dedicated one cent of our annual real estate tax rate to creating 
and continuing to fund our affordable housing trust fund. 

More recently, again through a public/private partnership, because 
Alexandria is so dense, but yet we have a critical need to 
meet our affordable housing objectives, we have the opportunity to 
build for the first time in more than 30 years a new fire station 
in our City, a new development area, and one of the solutions or 
compromise with the community in terms of building this four bay 
fire station was the need to ensure that we provided affordable 
housing and workforce housing. 

For the first time, we believe we are the first community in the 
Nation, we are building a new fire station that will have 64 units 
of public housing and workforce housing built on top of the fire station 
in a very growing community. ",33
HR1892 hearing.txt," In areas such as California, we have 
an FHA program that has been available for 70 years. And if you 
look at the drop in utilization in California because we are a high 
cost area, it is really stunning. In 2000, FHA insured 109,074 mortgages 
in California. In 2005, it was 51,037. In my district alone in 
2000, we had 7,000 mortgages. It dropped to 80. You are looking 
at a 99 percent drop in an area that arguably needs the benefit of 
an FHA program or a conforming program as much as any other 
State in the Nation does. In fact, in high cost areas it is much 
harder for people to get into",33
HR1892 hearing.txt," My 
bill allows any FHA-qualified borrower to participate in the new 
FHA low loan program. Second, the Frank-Waters bill authorizes 
the FHA to implement risk-based pricing but it leaves in place the 
current outdated premium caps of 2.25 percent up-front and 0.55 percent annually. And the zero and lower down payment loans  would have the higher caps. My concern is that these limits on premium caps will prevent FHA from serving riskier borrowers who  could be prudently served by charging a slightly higher premium.  With the flexibility to charge slightly higher premiums, FHA would  be able to serve borrowers with the lower FICO scores who are currently  being served only by the subprime market at very high interest  rates. With FHA mortgage insurance, lenders will charge 
borrowers the market mortgage interest rate. Without FHA insurance, 
they have no choice but to turn the borrower away or to 
charge for a risk in an increased mortgage interest rate. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt," Unfortunately, whether it is a State budget or 
Federal budget, there is no free lunch. To agree there is a—and I 
will use the term ‘‘benign,’’ for lack of better—funding source, since 
everybody has to answer to the appropriators and to the authorizers, 
if they can find that source, which many States have done, 
Florida has been able to raise $200- to $300 million through a real 
estate transfer tax, and some other States you will hear from later 
have done a wonderful job through document recording fees and 
other sources. 

I think it is very key. I think we all share in the goal of what 
the fund would do and what HUD does, but again, the key is what 
is the funding source. ",33
NHTF Hearing.txt,"
Mr. CISNEROS. There is very solid scientific evidence that shows 
that children in stable housing do better, not just in school but psychologically 
and in other ways. There is actual medical evidence 
that shows health conditions improve with the decency and stability 
and safety of housing. Overcrowding, substandard conditions, 
unsafe housing, lead paint problems, all of those impact children. 

I think it was Sheila’s group that just published or at least published 
another group’s report that said that actually, among minorities, 
they cite the quality of their marriage is impacted first 
and foremost by the quality of housing, more than any other factor 
but how much disposable income you have. The stability of the 
family is impacted by the quality of the housing.",33
NHTF Hearing.txt,"
Those who do manage to purchase a home face additional struggles. 
Studies show that minorities are 30 percent more likely to receive 
a higher priced loan than white borrowers, even after accounting 
for risk. 

Of course, housing affordability is not just a problem for minorities. 
People of all backgrounds are finding it harder and harder 
than ever to pay for housing. 

According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard 
University, more than one in seven U.S. households spend more 
than half their income on housing. 

Finding affordable rental housing is another growing problem. In 
the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, two million affordable housing 
units were lost. HUD estimated in 2005 that they were only 77 
units affordable and available for every 100 low-income renters. 

That means nearly a quarter of low-income families do not have 
access to decent rental housing. Whether you look at the facts or 
consider personal experiences, the conclusion is the same. Affordable 
housing is no longer merely a problem, it is a crisis, and we 
must all do our part to address it. ",33

CHRG-110hhrg35406.htm,"  Secretary Jackson. First of all, Congresswoman, I would 
disagree with you. I don't think it's our responsibility to 
tell people how they want to refinance their home or how they 
will finance their home. I do believe that if we do the FHA 
modernization--
    Mrs. Maloney. Well, calling a point of privilege, I wasn't 
saying that we should tell them how to finance their home or 
refinance their home; I was saying that if they could get into 
affordable housing, they would not be going into risky loans. I 
don't think anyone supports people going into loans that they 
can't afford; it certainly does not help the consumer, would 
you agree?
    Secretary Jackson. No, that's not true, Congresswoman, 
because many people do not want to deal at this present stage 
with FHA because it's so cumbersome, so they are going into the 
subprime loans. That's one of the reasons that I am just very, 
very concerned with this process. We want to change that. I 
agree with you. They shouldn't go into these loans. But many of 
these persons, like we just read in the paper the other day, 
prey on minorities--blacks and Hispanics--and when they sign 
these notes, they say it's 3 percent, but when you look at it 
it's actually 8 or 9 percent.
    They enter these agreements on their own. Now, we have done 
a lot of investigation through FHA--I mean, I'm sorry, through 
fair housing, equal opportunity--and we're beginning to come 
down on a number of these subprime lenders. That's what we can 
do. But we can't--
    Mrs. Maloney. Congratulations. Could you give us a report 
to this committee on who you came down on? Did you come down on 
Sentry? It's reported that they may be going bankrupt. They had 
a story about an 80-year-old woman who had a loan for $800; 
they refinanced it for her, to help her, so that now her 
payment was $4,000. She obviously lost her home.
    Secretary Jackson. That's right.
    Mrs. Maloney. So what are you doing? Seriously, I would 
love to see this in writing, because this is a huge crisis in 
the country. And if you've been going after these people, I 
think we should know about it.
    Secretary Jackson. I'll be happy to do it--give it to you.
    Mrs. Maloney. Have you taken steps against Sentry?
    Secretary Jackson. I can't tell you specifically against 
Sentry. I don't know exactly, but I'll get that information to 
you very quickly.
    Mrs. Maloney. Well, my time is up. And all I can say is, 
millions of people are turning their eyes to you and hoping 
that HUD can help with affordable housing; it's one of the 
biggest challenges that we confront in this country.",34

HR1892 hearing.txt," I work with 
my friend from Texas on a lot of issues, and there are a lot of areas 
where this committee can cooperate across party lines, but nowhere 
have the differences that do exist between the parties been made 
more clear than in his last statement when he described the effort 
by the gentlewoman from California and myself to provide more 
funding for affordable housing as ‘‘extortion.’’ The FHA is a Federal 
agency created by Federal law. And the notion that it is ‘‘extortion’’ 
to try to use some of the surplus funds it has been generating to 
help provide affordable housing greatly defines the difference between 
the parties. 

I noticed that the gentlewoman from Illinois—who temporarily 
had to leave and who has been a very constructive member also— 
said, ‘‘Well, we should not be using FHA funds for other purposes.’’ 
Maybe she missed this, but during the entire period of Republican 
majority rule, that is exactly what was happening. The FHA was 
producing surpluses which went into the general treasury, and 
they have been used to support such non-housing related issues as 
the war in Iraq, nuclear testing, or anything else the Federal Government 
does. This notion that money should not come from the 
FHA for other purposes is a very new one because the FHA has 
been a money maker for the rest of the Federal Government in the 
past. Now it is true that many of us—including the gentlewoman 
from California and I—believe that if the FHA continues to generate 
surpluses, and we certainly will guarantee that first claim on 
any monies goes to keep the FHA functioning, but the question is 
should the surpluses go into the general treasury and help offset 
everything else the Federal Government does, such as farm subsidies, 
the war in Iraq, bridges to nowhere, and all of those other 
purposes for which it was put, or should we target it towards affordable 
housing? ",34

which by the way, I have no receipts for next year, as it— 

The CHAIRMAN. You are not answering my question and I am 
going to ask it again. How much are you now getting that you 
think this will take away from you and tell me where. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. If you look at the budget, receipts of about 
$700 million from this year are used to offset HUD— 

The CHAIRMAN. You are getting $700 million this year, you said, 
right? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Every penny of it offsets HUD’s budget. 

The CHAIRMAN. The bill that we passed, the combination of the 
FHA bill and the housing trust fund bill, how much of that $700 
million would it take away from you? You said it would take money 
away from you. Would it take any of that money away from you? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Well— 

The CHAIRMAN. It is a fairly straightforward question. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. It would take money away from HUD because 
every penny— 

The CHAIRMAN. Commissioner, please, you know better than 
that. I am asking you a straightforward question. The $700 million 
you cited, would anything we are doing reduce that? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Every penny of our receipts— 

The CHAIRMAN. Can you give me a straight answer? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. I am trying to. 

The CHAIRMAN. No, you are not. You are trying to evade it. You 
said you are getting $700 million now. What are we doing that— 
would anything we are doing diminish that current flow of funds? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Maybe I am not understanding the question. 

The CHAIRMAN. Sure, you are. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. But every— 

The CHAIRMAN. In the bill, what would diminish the current flow 
of funds? What in the FHA bill— 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Because it has to be covered via the appropriation 
process. 

The CHAIRMAN. What has to be covered? The bill says, the FHA 
bill, that we increase revenues by raising the level of housing price 


29 


you can go to and we take the capital off the HECMs. That would 
generate some additional revenue. 

It certainly does not affect any existing revenue. Does anything 
that is being contemplated—if we were not to pass either bill, you 
do not lose anything, do you? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, the point I was trying to make earlier— 

The CHAIRMAN. I understand the point, you are trying to evade. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The appropriators— 

The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Commissioner. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The HUD budget is those receipts, and that 
is the point I was trying to make earlier; there is no excess. 

The CHAIRMAN. In the first place, that is a fiction, when they do 
the appropriation. Secondly, the question is we are talking about 
generating additional revenues for the FHA. 

I really am disappointed that you evaded the question. I take it 
nothing we are doing would diminish your current flow of funds. 

Are you confident that if we were in fact to go ahead with these 
increased revenue sources for the FHA through taking a cap off 
home equity mortgages and raising the amount of mortgages you 
can insure, that the Administration would ask that all of that be 
credited to the FHA? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, I am sorry. 

The CHAIRMAN. No, I want an answer to that question. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. I think I understand your question now, sir, 
I am sorry. Yes. We have— 

The CHAIRMAN. Answer the question I just asked you. If we were 
to generate the new revenues that are in the bill and did not assign 
them to the housing trust fund, are you confident the Administration 
would ask they go to the FHA? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, we hold back what we need. 

The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Commissioner. You understand that 
is not an answer to the question I asked. You really do. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. No, I do not understand, sir. I am trying to 
answer your question here. Sir, my point is— 

The CHAIRMAN. No, you are not. This is disappointing to me. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. We hold back what we need to cover claims 
which vary year-to-year, the gift downpayment programs I referenced 
earlier. 

The CHAIRMAN. I am talking about HUD. You know you are 
switching ground. You said HUD gets credit—you keep switching 
between the FHA and HUD in general, for purposes of obfuscation, 
which disappoints me. 

You said that HUD gets credit for the additional revenues that 
the FHA generates, correct? You did say that? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Yes. 

The CHAIRMAN. The legislation we are talking about doing would 
generate additional revenues for the FHA. You are aware of that? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Yes. The point is that— 

The CHAIRMAN. No. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. They would have to go back to the HUD 
budget from the appropriators which is what they have always 
done. 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes. I have asked you this question which you 
pretend not to understand. Are you confident that if we were to 


30 


generate these additional revenues by taking the cap off the home 
equity mortgages and raising the amount of mortgage you could insure, 
that the Administration would ask that HUD get the credit 
for that in its appropriation and that the appropriated amounts for 
HUD would increase? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, that, I do not know. 

The CHAIRMAN. You know the answer is no. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. I would say give it to the HOME program. 

The CHAIRMAN. I did not ask you what you would say. Again, you 
know you are deliberately not answering. I did not ask you what 
you would say. The point is this, what we have are constraints on 
the HUD budget and the notion that if we were to increase money 
for the FHA, that would be additive to the HUD budget, is not 
true. I believe you know it is not true. I am disappointed that you 
would even pretend that it might be the case. 

The HUD budget is constrained by other factors. In fact, it is the 
Administration that is trying to raise the FHA fees. We have legislation 
to prevent you from raising them. The legislation we are 
talking about says that if any of these revenue diversions were to 
jeopardize the FHA solvency and require more money from the appropriators, 
it would not go into effect. 

Your notion is that we would get a total additional for HUD, that 
HUD would get the credit for any additional FHA money, and that 
simply has not been the case. During your tenure, has that been 
the case? Has the HUD budget overall increased proportionately? 
Have FHA surpluses gone up? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. About $1.6 billion this year from the previous 
year. 

The CHAIRMAN. Did it go up proportionately because of the FHA 
getting more funds? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The FHA is self-sufficient, sir. 

The CHAIRMAN. Commissioner, please, stop that. You said that 
the HUD gets— 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. We are in the hole right now, sir. We are in 
the hole. I do not have any money. 

The CHAIRMAN. In the past, throughout your tenure, has the 
FHA been losing money? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, as you know, we are trying to fix FHA 
from being in the hole but it was not too long ago, including under 
Secretary Cisneros, FHA was generating a lot of money. That is not 
the case today. As we all know, and this committee was great in 
helping us get the FHA bill through— 

The CHAIRMAN. I agree with that. The point is there has been no 
correlation between the FHA surplus or deficit and the HUD budget. 
Here is your argument, that we should not take additional revenues 
we generate for the FHA and put them into affordable housing 
because otherwise it would have gone to the HUD budget. I do 
not think anybody in the world believes that is true. I am disappointed 
to hear you say it. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, I am just looking at the budget we publish 
every year, and it clearly has a credit for our receipts under 
the HUD budget. I know what you are trying to say, sir. Looking 
at what it has on our budget books—

sir. 

The CHAIRMAN. You told me you are losing money now. You said 
you were in the hole. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The die has been cast, that we are not producing— 


The CHAIRMAN. You just said—Commissioner, I have never been 
more disappointed in somebody’s testimony than yours. The notion 
that the HUD budget goes up, that there is a causal link between 
increased FHA revenues—of course, as my colleagues point out, 
this Administration keeps trying to cut the budget. We have been 
able to stop some of that. 

The notion that the additional FHA money would translate into 
additional funding for HOME or CDBG, if that is the argument 
against this bill, I look forward to the debate. ",34

HR1892 hearing.txt,"Finally, the most significant difference 
between the bill I introduced and the Frank-Waters FHA reform 
proposal is of greater concern to me and many of my colleagues and 
that is the inclusion of a provision that creates a funding place 
holder that envisions using FHA funds to support the creation of 
a national housing trust fund. While the other provisions that I 
have mentioned are the ones that represent significant differences 
between our introduced bills, using FHA program funds to create 
a housing trust fund is the most objectionable, and I believe that 
it is not an appropriate use of FHA funds. Taking funds out of FHA 
and using them for a purpose unrelated to its core mission would 
threaten the solvency of the FHA fund and its ability to pay out

sleep on the street? We have to have alternatives for them and 
should be planning, so what plans do you have to respond to 
this crisis that we're reading about every day in the paper?
    Secretary Jackson. First of all, Congresswoman, I would 
disagree with you. I don't think it's our responsibility to 
tell people how they want to refinance their home or how they 
will finance their home. I do believe that if we do the FHA 
modernization--
    Mrs. Maloney. Well, calling a point of privilege, I wasn't 
saying that we should tell them how to finance their home or 
refinance their home; I was saying that if they could get into 
affordable housing, they would not be going into risky loans. I 
don't think anyone supports people going into loans that they 
can't afford; it certainly does not help the consumer, would 
you agree?
    Secretary Jackson. No, that's not true, Congresswoman, 
because many people do not want to deal at this present stage 
with FHA because it's so cumbersome, so they are going into the 
subprime loans. That's one of the reasons that I am just very, 
very concerned with this process. We want to change that. I 
agree with you. They shouldn't go into these loans. But many of 
these persons, like we just read in the paper the other day, 
prey on minorities--blacks and Hispanics--and when they sign 
these notes, they say it's 3 percent, but when you look at it 
it's actually 8 or 9 percent.
    They enter these agreements on their own. Now, we have done 
a lot of investigation through FHA--I mean, I'm sorry, through 
fair housing, equal opportunity--and we're beginning to come 
down on a number of these subprime lenders. That's what we can 
do. But we can't--
    Mrs. Maloney. Congratulations. Could you give us a report 
to this committee on who you came down on? Did you come down on 
Sentry? It's reported that they may be going bankrupt. They had 
a story about an 80-year-old woman who had a loan for $800; 
they refinanced it for her, to help her, so that now her 
payment was $4,000. She obviously lost her home.
    Secretary Jackson. That's right.
    Mrs. Maloney. So what are you doing? Seriously, I would 
love to see this in writing, because this is a huge crisis in 
the country. And if you've been going after these people, I 
think we should know about it.
    Secretary Jackson. I'll be happy to do it--give it to you.
    Mrs. Maloney. Have you taken steps against Sentry?
    Secretary Jackson. I can't tell you specifically against 
Sentry. I don't know exactly, but I'll get that information to 
you very quickly.
    Mrs. Maloney. Well, my time is up. And all I can say is,

NHTF Hearing.txt,"Indeed, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund outlined in Chairman 
Frank’s bill is modeled to a great degree on one of those HUD initiatives, 
the Home Investment Partnership Program. 

The latest Federal Block Grant for States—I mean, I’m sorry, the 
largest Federal Block Grant for State and local government, HOME 
is designed to create affordable housing for low-income households. 
It is a successful program. It has a proven track record. 

Establishing another, a new housing trust fund, separate and 
apart from HOME and promulgating new regulations and rules at 
HUD could take months or years to properly implement. HOME is 
already up and running with 50 States, 585 local governments, and 
four insular areas presently administering the existing successful 
program. 

Rather than reinventing the wheel, I believe a better approach 
would be to take this opportunity to make an already successful 
Federal program work better by using HOME to increase production

to very-low and extremely-low-income families. ",34

employees. You know that, Mr. Jimenez. You are not being honest 
with us intellectually. I am disappointed in that. You know we 
are talking about employees. We are asking about whether a 
Mayor can give money to the Nation of Islam to provide security 
services and hire only congregants of the Nation of Islam? Is 
that----
    Mr. Jimenez. I am being completely honest. I thought I 
heard in your answer something about beneficiaries. However, as 
far as taking religion into account when hiring----
    Mr. Frank. No, answer the question. It is a simple 
question. The Nation of Islam, under these rules, are they an 
eligible grantee and can they then hire only people who are 
members of the Nation of Islam?
    Mr. Jimenez. If the Nation of Islam is a legitimate 
religious organization. I don't know enough about the Nation of 
Islam to comment on that.
    Mr. Frank. I had hoped maybe you would answer a question 
honestly. I think you are not.
    Next one. How about Scientology? Suppose a Mayor somewhere 
gives a grant to the Church of Scientology, which has been 
recognized as a religion. You say legitimate religion. I assume 
the test here is--let me ask. Is there a test other than the 
one we use, the IRS' tax exemption? Is there some other test 
that is going to be involved here as to whether you are a 
legitimate religion? That would make us very nervous. How do 
you decide?
    Mr. Jimenez. The only test that this Administration applies 
is whether or not the services provided by the faith-based 
organization work.
    Mr. Frank. No, Mr. Jimenez, you are changing the subject, 
and you know it. You said you don't know if the Nation of Islam 
is a legitimate religion. I understood they were a legitimate 
religion by the applicable test: They got a tax exemption, and 
they are recognized by the IRS. Are you suggesting that there 
is some additional test as to whether or not you are a 
legitimate religion to qualify?
    Mr. Jimenez. I don't know if there is something else about 
the Nation of Islam that could disqualify them from the 
program.
    Mr. Frank. I am asking you procedurally now. Your 
determination not to answer tough questions is impressive, but 
it doesn't get you away from the tough issues. In this program, 
it says faith-based organizations. We are talking now not about 
HUD but about the entitlement communities. I am the Mayor of an 
entitlement community. Under this program, if it is legally 
recognized as a religion by State and Federal law, are they 
then automatically eligible for grants under the CDBG faith-
based program and can hire only their own?

NHTF Hearing.txt,"Mr. WATT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Mr. Montgomery, let me approach this a slightly different way 
because in reading your testimony and hearing the exchange that 
has taken place, it seems to me that what you are saying is that 
HUD has a certain budget and if we make more money available, 
that money is not likely to be used for this purpose. It is just going 
to be used as a substitute. 

Is that what you are saying? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. That is what the appropriators do. 

Mr. SHAYS. Say ‘‘yes.’’ 

Mr. WATT. If that is what you are saying. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Yes. 

Mr. WATT. It seems to me that the logical consequence of what 
you are saying is under those circumstances what we are doing will 
not inure to the purpose that we intend for it to inure to because 
the money is coming to HUD and consequently the inappropriate 
place to send the money is to HUD because if you send it to HUD, 
there is going to be a substitution for what HUD is already doing. 

I am not wedded to sending this money to HUD. I think the trust 
fund could be set up someplace else and the money sent someplace 
else if you are concerned about this money being substituted for 
money that HUD is already getting. 


32 


The question I want to ask is, since you do not seem to think 
HUD ought to get this money under these circumstances, who 
would be the appropriate alternative beneficiaries to administer 
the housing trust fund other than HUD, since under your analysis, 
HUD ought not be getting it because it will just be a substitute for 
what you are already doing? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, my point was that I think HUD should. 

Mr. WATT. I did not ask you what your point was. You have 
made your point. I am trying to make my point now. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Yes, sir. 

Mr. WATT. My point is who would be the other alternative beneficiaries 
to administer the housing trust fund other than HUD? You 
have obviously eliminated HUD now as an appropriate beneficiary 
of the funds, under your analysis. 

Who would be the other appropriate beneficiaries to administer 
a housing trust fund since the official position of HUD seems to be 
that you do not want it over there because it will conflict with 
other things? 

What are the alternatives that we have as to where to send this 
money? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, actually, I did want HUD to keep the 
funds, as they do now. That was a point I made in my remarks, 
which you missed, sir. 

Mr. WATT. I missed those remarks. In the exchange you just had, 
it sounded to me like you were saying, do not send this money over 
here. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. No, sir. 

Mr. WATT. Because it will be used for the purposes we are already 
achieving. If you want to add to those purposes, you need to 
send it somewhere else. 

Let’s assume that is what you were saying because I think everybody 
in the room heard those conflicting things that you were saying, 
what would be some of the alternative places to send the 
money other than HUD? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. In the hypothetical sense, sir? 

Mr. WATT. In the hypothetical sense. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. I think some States are doing some wonderful 
jobs with their housing trust funds. 

Mr. WATT. If we set up a mechanism that said States do not substitute 
this for what you are already doing, put it on top, which is 
what Mr. Frank says we were going to do for HUD, you think the 
States would be able to apply that standard better than HUD 
would be able to apply it? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The States could decide they want to use it 
for their HOME funds. 

Mr. WATT. No. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Hypothetically, sir. 

Mr. WATT. We would tell them no, you cannot do that. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Hypothetically, as well. Thinking hypothetically. 


Mr. WATT. We were trying to tell you no, you cannot do it. You 
cannot substitute it for HOME funds either. You are saying that 
we can tell the States that, but we cannot tell HUD that? 


33 


Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, that would obviously be a decision for 
you, but back to my point, I think States, whether it augments 
their trust fund, again hypothetically, I think many States are set 
up to do that right now. Some of them are testifying here later 
today. I think they would tell you. 

Mr. WATT. I am sure they are going to say yes, send the money 
to us. HUD is about the only place I know of that says, do not send 
money over here because it might substitute for some money we already 
have, which is what you seem to be saying. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. No, we would take any extra money obviously 
that the appropriators would give us, but in the case that we offset 
our budget with my receipts, that money would have to come from 
somewhere else if I did not offset that budget. That was the point 
I was trying to make earlier, sir. Thank you. 

Mr. WATT. I do not understand what you are saying. 

The CHAIRMAN. I have been working on HUD budgets for 27 
years. It has never been the position of the appropriators that the 
amount appropriated to HUD would rise or fall according to FHA 
receipts. It is a bookkeeping matter whereby FHA receipts are entered 
into the general fund, but no one has ever suggested that the 
budget of HUD goes up or down in any way dependent on net receipts 
and losses from the FHA. I have been working on HUD 
budgets since coming here. ",34
GSE hearing.txt,"r. GARRETT. I appreciate that comment, and actually, Mr. Stern 
was making that same sort of suggestion earlier, in his testimony, 
that as any day you said you open the paper, it goes up and goes 
down, what have you, as far as overall economy in the housing 
market. 

The testimony that we received on this issue in the past when 
that was raised was just contrary, unfortunately, to what you’re 


22 


saying and what Mr. Stern was saying. What this testimony and 
the evidence indicates, reports and studies of GSEs says that instead 
of stepping into the market to pick up where you would hope 
that they would do the good job that they are supposed to by their 
mission, instead what they do, in essence, is to cherry-pick the 
market, and that the private market still has sufficient capacity to 
address it, but the GSEs basically come in as the suitor of the best 
portion of the market, and takes that. And that is what they have 
been holding primarily in their portfolio, even during those downtimes, 
when we wish that the GSEs were doing the job which was 
the core mission to satisfy the underlying market. 

Mr. ROBBINS. I appreciate what you’re saying, Representative. 
What I was saying is in this particular case, there was a day or 
two immediately following all of those events where there was no 
market, other than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The private market 
was not there to support—I sold mortgages through those markets. 
And that’s the kind of events that need the liquidity that we 
are talking about. 

What the MBA proposes is that a world-class regulator— 

Mr. GARRETT. Yes, but again, that goes to what—Chairman 
Greenspan testified on those points, because we addressed the 
exact same points after the fact. 

Mr. ROBBINS. Well, I can tell you, after the First Gulf War, there 
was no market for 2 days following the announcement of the war. 
The mortgage-backed securities market was unavailable, while it 
tried to reprice itself. 

Mr. GARRETT. And GSEs were in during those 2 days, picking up 
all those periods? 

Mr. ROBBINS. That’s correct. 

Mr. GARRETT. And that lasted after the 2-day period? 

Mr. ROBBINS. They posted a price, if memory serves, the afternoon 
that it was announced, and had a price the following morning. 

But beyond that issue, that’s why we feel that a world-class regulator 
should make the determination on what that portfolio size 
should be, and what the leverage should be on that. We know that 
outstanding mortgage debt is going to grow, according to Harvard 
University, some $20 trillion over the course of the next 20 years 
or so. 

And so, it is inconsistent today to sit there and think about what 
would be the right number to attach to the GSEs. That’s why a 
strong regulator, world-class regulator, should be there, both as the 
market rises and falls in size, or rises and falls, should be the one 
to make that determination. 

Mr. GARRETT. Okay. I saw a lot of other hands. 

Mr. MENZIES. I would be the very last to question Mr. 
Bernanke’s economic logic on the rise and fall of prices in the secondary 
market. As a community banker, I do know, however, that 
we need access to that market. And the 5,000-some community 
banks that belong to ICBA are basically small banks. We are little 
banks, and I don’t know what we compose of the total secondary 
market, but it’s not a whole lot; it’s a fairly small percentage of the 
whole. 

So, having access to that market is critical. If you were to theorize 
that reducing the size of the portfolio, and setting capital lim



23 


its, and reducing the quantity of loans that Freddie Mac and 
Fannie Mae can guarantee would, in fact, improve market prices, 
that is possible, I guess. 

Mr. GARRETT. Well, no one is suggesting that would reduce the 
amount of loans that they are—would be able to go secure from 
them, but simply that they would no longer be holding the mortgages 
as they have, but instead would do what their core function 
is, to securitize those loans. 

Right now, one of the other testimonies was a testimony that 
they are only holding around a third of their loan in their—which 
is basically their core function—the secondary market loans. 

By reducing their overall portfolio to just a limitation in that 
area, how would that reduce your ability of liquidating in a market, 
if they were securitizing the rest of the market? 

Mr. MENZIES. Well, yes, if you believe that is the case, then that 
would not hurt community banks. I think our concern is that it 
could hurt community banks if it reduced our access to the market. 

Mr. GARRETT. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Menzies. Mr. Price? Yes, sure. ",34

addressing about 40,000 in 2001. So, maybe from your 
perspective it's not enough, but I think--
    Ms. Velazquez. It's not enough when you could be--
    Secretary Jackson. Well, but we made--
    Ms. Velazquez.--you gave an increase of 50 percent to the 
Dream Down Payment Act, and only 19 percent to the housing 
counseling.
    Secretary Jackson. No, no. See, I think, Congresswoman, 
you're mixing apples and oranges. The American Dream Down 
Payment is to help people with the closing costs and down 
payment. It has nothing to do with housing counseling. Housing 
counseling--
    Ms. Velazquez. Of course, I know that. So, on the one hand, 
you are helping people to buy their homes, but on the other 
hand, you're not putting enough money to provide housing 
counseling to prevent foreclosure.

CBDG is cut by more than $700 million. Under the current 
distribution formula, New York City will lose $58 million. I 
understand that HUD is proposing a new formula. Will this make 
up for the cuts, and when can we expect to see this proposal?
    Secretary Jackson. Let me say this to you. I just answered 
that to the Congresswoman from West Virginia. We have cities 
that are receiving large sums of monies, that I really don't 
think should be receiving those monies. I think we should 
concentrate the block grant program to those cities most in 
need where we have the highest rate of poverty, where we have 
the highest rate of the ability to make substantial changes in 
the quality of life for people. And in this case, we are trying 
to reallocate that based on where we see the greatest poverty 
need, not pockets of poverties in wealthy areas. That's a 
totally different situation.
    So if we--if the proposal is accepted by Congress and 
passed, then, yes, I think that clearly those areas where the 
greatest needs are will be addressed.",34
CHRG-108hhrg89410.htm,"So the answer is yes.
    Secondly, with regard to preemption or diminution of State 
and local laws, what--there is language in here--it doesn't say 
specifically is that they don't apply. It says they will retain 
their independence from State and local laws. I must say that 
as we debated that, as I recall, a couple of years ago on the 
floor of the House and in committee the general understanding 
was that that probably meant that they wouldn't have to comply 
with them.
    What is the effect? If there is a State or local law 
requiring nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation or 
marital status or religion, does that apply or not apply?
    Mr. Jimenez. Neither the proposed regulation nor the 
Executive Order, as you indicated, specifically addresses the 
issue of preemption.
    Mr. Frank. That is what I am asking you now. What do you 
think it means? How are you guys going to interpret it?
    Mr. Jimenez. It is the Administration's position that--
first of all, preemption questions are highly unlikely to arise 
because----
    Mr. Frank. They just did. Excuse me. I hate to contradict 
you. I just raised it.
    Mr. Jimenez. In the real world outside of Congress.
    Mr. Frank. Let me just say that you are wrong. We have had 
this with regard to San Francisco. We have had it with regard 
to New York City. The notion that there won't be some conflict 
between local laws and Federal policy--in fact, we had a debate 
on the floor of the House about whether or not we would change 
the law because of a domestic partnership issue involving San 
Francisco. I think it was under some Federal program.
    So I need to know the answer. What is your answer?
    Mr. Jimenez. I believe you are correct. They will arise 
from time to time, just not regularly. But the answer is that 
preemption questions are to be decided be the courts on a case-
by-case basis.
    Mr. Frank. They won't be decided by the courts unless 
someone gets them into the courts.
    What is the Administration's position? You say the 
Administration is not going to take a position?
    Mr. Jimenez. If a State or local ordinance specifically 
targets faith-based organizations----
    Mr. Frank. Mr. Jimenez, stop beating around the bush. You 
know better. If you don't want to answer the question, tell me. 
You are not here under subpoena. You can refuse to answer the 
question. But let's not waste time.
    We are not talking, as you know, about laws that 
specifically target religious groups. We are talking about an 
antidiscrimination law of general applicability at the State or 
local level that a religious organization may feel impinges on 
it. Is it the Administration's position that they cannot abide 
by that because of the language here about their independence 
from State and local governments?
    Mr. Jimenez. Neither the proposed regulation nor the 
Executive Order take a position on that question.
    Mr. Frank. So the Administration has no position on it?
    Mr. Jimenez. No, sir. Not at this time.
    Mr. Frank. Let me ask Mr. Weicher. If I am a Mayor of a 
city, I ask HUD: What does it mean? Or if I ask the general 
counsel, what would you tell me?
    Mr. Weicher. Mr. Frank, it will be--when the issue is 
raised, it would be addressed by the Department and by the 
Administration. It would not be addressed by my office, of 
course, but it would be addressed.
    Mr. Frank. You are here as HUD's representative.
    Mr. Weicher. Yes. But, as you know, I am not a lawyer.
    Mr. Frank. That is very disappointing. Let me give you the 
answer I don't think you want to give. The answer is, yes, you 
want it to be preempted, but you are a little bit unclear about 
the ability to preempt a State law by Executive Order. I must 
say, when this arose in the context of the statute, it was 
clear that that same language was intended to be preemptive. 
And, because you are now dealing with a situation where you 
can't preempt you are going to duck the question.
    But I people ought to be clear that that is the--that was 
the intention, that is essentially what you have in mind.
    Mr. Jimenez. Sir, if it were specifically intended to be 
preemptive, there would have been language to that effect.
    Mr. Frank. No, because if you got too explicit you could 
run into some kinds of problems. It was specifically intended 
to be preemptive. But let me ask you, as a matter of policy, do 
you think it should or shouldn't be?
    Mr. Jimenez. My personal opinion, I believe----
    Mr. Frank. No, not your personal opinion, HUD, the official 
Administration position. You are not here personally. You are 
here as a representative of the Administration.
    Mr. Jimenez. As I said earlier, each case would have to be 
determined on the facts of each specific case. So we would make 
that determination on a case-by-case basis. We would look at 
the local or State ordinance in question, we would look at the 
terminology, the intended effect, the scope of the ordinance or 
the law, and then apply the law as we understand it at that 
time. But we don't see this rule or the Executive Order as 
having a blanket preemptive effect one way or the other.

HR1892 hearing.txt,"Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I work with 
my friend from Texas on a lot of issues, and there are a lot of areas 
where this committee can cooperate across party lines, but nowhere 
have the differences that do exist between the parties been made 
more clear than in his last statement when he described the effort 
by the gentlewoman from California and myself to provide more 
funding for affordable housing as ‘‘extortion.’’ The FHA is a Federal 
agency created by Federal law. And the notion that it is ‘‘extortion’’ 
to try to use some of the surplus funds it has been generating to 
help provide affordable housing greatly defines the difference between 
the parties. 

I noticed that the gentlewoman from Illinois—who temporarily 
had to leave and who has been a very constructive member also— 
said, ‘‘Well, we should not be using FHA funds for other purposes.’’ 
Maybe she missed this, but during the entire period of Republican 
majority rule, that is exactly what was happening. The FHA was 
producing surpluses which went into the general treasury, and 
they have been used to support such non-housing related issues as 
the war in Iraq, nuclear testing, or anything else the Federal Government 
does. This notion that money should not come from the 
FHA for other purposes is a very new one because the FHA has 
been a money maker for the rest of the Federal Government in the 
past. Now it is true that many of us—including the gentlewoman 
from California and I—believe that if the FHA continues to generate 
surpluses, and we certainly will guarantee that first claim on 
any monies goes to keep the FHA functioning, but the question is 
should the surpluses go into the general treasury and help offset 
everything else the Federal Government does, such as farm subsidies, 
the war in Iraq, bridges to nowhere, and all of those other 
purposes for which it was put, or should we target it towards affordable 
housing? 

The gentlewoman from Illinois also expressed surprise, and to 
some extent disappointment, that the gentlewoman from California 
and I have a different version of the bill than the one that passed 
last year. And the gentlewoman from Illinois correctly noted that 
last year the gentlewoman from California and I supported a different 
version of the bill but, again, maybe she forgot something 
happened in the interim: the election. The gentlewoman from California 
and I are strongly committed to trying to help homeowner-
ship, to bring down costs for housing in general, and to help the 
middle class, but also to do something about that very significant 
fraction of our population who are not adequately housed, and who 
that pay too much for housing. Last year we did the best we could, 
we were not in the majority. We were being constructive. In fact, 
I think you could say we were setting a good example for our 


7 


friends. When you are in the minority, you recognize that you are 
not going to write the major pieces of the bill and you cooperate 
to get the best deal you can. That is what the gentlewoman from 
California and I did. I know there have been people who have been 
surprised that we have not lived up to their stereotypes and that 
we have, in fact, been cooperative and conciliatory given the circumstances. 
Things are different now. And there are a lot of things 
that the parties have in common, but we have always had the view 
that we should be reaching out to help people who are in economic 
distress and now that we represent the majority, we plan to do 
that. 

And let me talk specifically about the terms under which the 
FHA would be lending to people with more credit risk. Yes, the bill 
that we are supporting says that if you or someone with higher 
credit risk and a lower credit score borrows the money and diligently 
pays it back, you should not, in the end, be charged more 
by your own Federal Government than someone making 3 times as 
much money as you. That is the radical proposition which we are 
advocating. We recognize there is a risk, and we said, okay, there 
will be some higher up-front premiums. But we say that if you 
meet your obligations, if you work very hard and pay back what 
you owe, why should you pay more than somebody who makes far 
more money than you because other people in your situation previously 
defaulted? 

Now the gentlewoman said, ‘‘Well, that rule was strict, what is 
available?’’ No, only if you consider the higher credit risk people to 
be a closed pot. I, along with the gentlewoman from California, 
have been preaching, and I think finally we are going to win and 
we are going to admit California, Massachusetts, and New York to 
the Union. We are going to allow them to fully participate in Federal 
housing programs: FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. They 
have been somewhat excluded for some time. That will generate 
some revenues, and we intend to take some of the additional revenues 
generated within this set of programs and use them to make 
the radical proposition—that if you are of a higher credit risk and 
you borrow money and you get your mortgage insurance from the 
FHA and you pay back every penny you were supposed to, that you 
will not be charged more by your own Federal Government—true. 
That is the best thing we can do about the subprime market. 

And there was also a comparison to insurance. Well, this is the 
Federal Government. I do not think that the Federal Government 
ought to—I know there is a dispute about whether or not we 
should help the poor at the expense of the wealthy but is there 
really an argument that we should penalize lower income people by 
charging them more for exactly the same mortgage insurance as 
someone who makes 3 times as much because somebody else who 
makes the same amount they do did not pay it back? So, yes, that 
is what we are saying. We are saying that if the FHA is to generate 
surpluses, as it has for 12 years, rather than that money 
going for earmarks in the agricultural surpluses and wars and 
trips and other things, it should be recycled to some extent for affordable 
housing, which does help everybody as you add to housing. 
One of the problems we have had is a housing program whereby 
we have only done vouchers so we have added to the demand for 


8 


housing without increasing the supply. And we also believe that in 
dealing with people in the subprime category, we should extend to 
them the ability to go to the FHA and be helped. And if they make 
their payments like anybody else, they should not be charged more 
than anybody else. 

I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership, which has been so 
strong in this area. ",34
NHTF Hearing.txt,"The CHAIRMAN. I am going to recognize myself. What funds is 
HUD now getting in the absence of this FHA and housing trust 
fund bill that you would lose? Please identify them for me. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. We keep back a certain amount of receipts 
which by the way, I have no receipts for next year, as it— 

The CHAIRMAN. You are not answering my question and I am 
going to ask it again. How much are you now getting that you 
think this will take away from you and tell me where. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. If you look at the budget, receipts of about 
$700 million from this year are used to offset HUD— 

The CHAIRMAN. You are getting $700 million this year, you said, 
right? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Every penny of it offsets HUD’s budget. 

The CHAIRMAN. The bill that we passed, the combination of the 
FHA bill and the housing trust fund bill, how much of that $700 
million would it take away from you? You said it would take money 
away from you. Would it take any of that money away from you? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Well— 

The CHAIRMAN. It is a fairly straightforward question. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. It would take money away from HUD because 
every penny— 

The CHAIRMAN. Commissioner, please, you know better than 
that. I am asking you a straightforward question. The $700 million 
you cited, would anything we are doing reduce that? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Every penny of our receipts— 

The CHAIRMAN. Can you give me a straight answer? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. I am trying to. 

The CHAIRMAN. No, you are not. You are trying to evade it. You 
said you are getting $700 million now. What are we doing that— 
would anything we are doing diminish that current flow of funds? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Maybe I am not understanding the question. 

The CHAIRMAN. Sure, you are. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. But every— 

The CHAIRMAN. In the bill, what would diminish the current flow 
of funds? What in the FHA bill— 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Because it has to be covered via the appropriation 
process. 

The CHAIRMAN. What has to be covered? The bill says, the FHA 
bill, that we increase revenues by raising the level of housing price 


29 


you can go to and we take the capital off the HECMs. That would 
generate some additional revenue. 

It certainly does not affect any existing revenue. Does anything 
that is being contemplated—if we were not to pass either bill, you 
do not lose anything, do you? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, the point I was trying to make earlier— 

The CHAIRMAN. I understand the point, you are trying to evade. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The appropriators— 

The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Commissioner. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The HUD budget is those receipts, and that 
is the point I was trying to make earlier; there is no excess. 

The CHAIRMAN. In the first place, that is a fiction, when they do 
the appropriation. Secondly, the question is we are talking about 
generating additional revenues for the FHA. 

I really am disappointed that you evaded the question. I take it 
nothing we are doing would diminish your current flow of funds. 

Are you confident that if we were in fact to go ahead with these 
increased revenue sources for the FHA through taking a cap off 
home equity mortgages and raising the amount of mortgages you 
can insure, that the Administration would ask that all of that be 
credited to the FHA? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, I am sorry. 

The CHAIRMAN. No, I want an answer to that question. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. I think I understand your question now, sir, 
I am sorry. Yes. We have— 

The CHAIRMAN. Answer the question I just asked you. If we were 
to generate the new revenues that are in the bill and did not assign 
them to the housing trust fund, are you confident the Administration 
would ask they go to the FHA? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, we hold back what we need. 

The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Commissioner. You understand that 
is not an answer to the question I asked. You really do. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. No, I do not understand, sir. I am trying to 
answer your question here. Sir, my point is— 

The CHAIRMAN. No, you are not. This is disappointing to me. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. We hold back what we need to cover claims 
which vary year-to-year, the gift downpayment programs I referenced 
earlier. 

The CHAIRMAN. I am talking about HUD. You know you are 
switching ground. You said HUD gets credit—you keep switching 
between the FHA and HUD in general, for purposes of obfuscation, 
which disappoints me. 

You said that HUD gets credit for the additional revenues that 
the FHA generates, correct? You did say that? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Yes. 

The CHAIRMAN. The legislation we are talking about doing would 
generate additional revenues for the FHA. You are aware of that? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Yes. The point is that— 

The CHAIRMAN. No. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. They would have to go back to the HUD 
budget from the appropriators which is what they have always 
done. 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes. I have asked you this question which you 
pretend not to understand. Are you confident that if we were to 


30 


generate these additional revenues by taking the cap off the home 
equity mortgages and raising the amount of mortgage you could insure, 
that the Administration would ask that HUD get the credit 
for that in its appropriation and that the appropriated amounts for 
HUD would increase? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, that, I do not know. 

The CHAIRMAN. You know the answer is no. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. I would say give it to the HOME program. 

The CHAIRMAN. I did not ask you what you would say. Again, you 
know you are deliberately not answering. I did not ask you what 
you would say. The point is this, what we have are constraints on 
the HUD budget and the notion that if we were to increase money 
for the FHA, that would be additive to the HUD budget, is not 
true. I believe you know it is not true. I am disappointed that you 
would even pretend that it might be the case. 

The HUD budget is constrained by other factors. In fact, it is the 
Administration that is trying to raise the FHA fees. We have legislation 
to prevent you from raising them. The legislation we are 
talking about says that if any of these revenue diversions were to 
jeopardize the FHA solvency and require more money from the appropriators, 
it would not go into effect. 

Your notion is that we would get a total additional for HUD, that 
HUD would get the credit for any additional FHA money, and that 
simply has not been the case. During your tenure, has that been 
the case? Has the HUD budget overall increased proportionately? 
Have FHA surpluses gone up? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. About $1.6 billion this year from the previous 
year. 

The CHAIRMAN. Did it go up proportionately because of the FHA 
getting more funds? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The FHA is self-sufficient, sir. 

The CHAIRMAN. Commissioner, please, stop that. You said that 
the HUD gets— 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. We are in the hole right now, sir. We are in 
the hole. I do not have any money. 

The CHAIRMAN. In the past, throughout your tenure, has the 
FHA been losing money? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, as you know, we are trying to fix FHA 
from being in the hole but it was not too long ago, including under 
Secretary Cisneros, FHA was generating a lot of money. That is not 
the case today. As we all know, and this committee was great in 
helping us get the FHA bill through— 

The CHAIRMAN. I agree with that. The point is there has been no 
correlation between the FHA surplus or deficit and the HUD budget. 
Here is your argument, that we should not take additional revenues 
we generate for the FHA and put them into affordable housing 
because otherwise it would have gone to the HUD budget. I do 
not think anybody in the world believes that is true. I am disappointed 
to hear you say it. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sir, I am just looking at the budget we publish 
every year, and it clearly has a credit for our receipts under 
the HUD budget. I know what you are trying to say, sir. Looking 
at what it has on our budget books—

The CHAIRMAN. You said the FHA has been losing money recently. 


Mr. MONTGOMERY. I am sorry, sir? 

The CHAIRMAN. It has been losing money, correct? 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. We will start losing money in about 2 months, 
sir. 

The CHAIRMAN. You told me you are losing money now. You said 
you were in the hole. 

Mr. MONTGOMERY. The die has been cast, that we are not producing— 


The CHAIRMAN. You just said—Commissioner, I have never been 
more disappointed in somebody’s testimony than yours. The notion 
that the HUD budget goes up, that there is a causal link between 
increased FHA revenues—of course, as my colleagues point out, 
this Administration keeps trying to cut the budget. We have been 
able to stop some of that. 

The notion that the additional FHA money would translate into 
additional funding for HOME or CDBG, if that is the argument 
against this bill, I look forward to the debate. ",34

the other day, Fannie and Freddie's patrons on Capitol Hill

trillion-dollar-plus mortgage portfolios so long as they helped 
meet political goals on housing.
