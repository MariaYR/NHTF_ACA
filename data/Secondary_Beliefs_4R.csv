NHTF Hearing.txt," a trust fund has dedicated sources 
of revenue, and that the State and local trust funds that this actually 
does more closely resemble, the ones that have been the most 
successful and the ones that have been sustainable and the ones 
that have been able to really make a huge difference, are the ones 
that have dedicated sources of revenue. 

And generally, that is where folks have moved to. So we have 
just heard Mayor Euille describe what they did eventually to get 
to what it is that they are putting in there. And so that is why you 
create this and then you figure out what you are going to do with 
it. 

There are two objectives: One, getting more production dollars 
for ELI households; and two, having dedicated sources of revenue 
that we can rely on over time. ",18
NHTF Hearing.txt," add that having a National 
Housing Trust Fund, again, that can help supplement what we do 
on a State and local level will afford an opportunity for localities 
then to use their own tax general revenue dollars to help meet the 
needs of those who are being affected or impacted by predatory 
lending schemes and/or foreclosure. 

So it has a lot of benefits. But perhaps this piece of legislation 
will not directly address those needs, but certainly afford an opportunity 
for localities to then utilize some of their own dollars. ",18
NHTF Hearing.txt," Again, as part of the 2007 budget as well, a 
proposed increase on some multifamily programs. As you know,

really can't afford them. We are saying to them, it might take 
you a year through our program to get you ready for a home, but 
the moment you move in, you will be ready to keep that home and 
stabilize that home. I believe that clearly that is not the 
case that the Congresswoman talked about in the subprime 
market. They're going in and really--it's very disheartening 
what they're doing to a lot of people because, if you think 
about it, many of us are well educated, and we don't read all 
the papers when we sign a loan. So many of these people are not 
going to read the papers either, and they sign the loans and 
they get duped in other words.
    So our position is, is we're working with housing 
counseling groups around this country. They've been very, very 
accessible. We're working with a lot of faith-based groups 
around the country that are counseling people for housing. And 
we've seen the results. People are keeping their homes, the 
ones that we have worked with. We gave you an example of the 
21,000 who have gone through the housing counseling program and 
used the American Dream Down Payment.",19

I guess one problem I have is—I’m not arguing but I have a real 
problem with the comment you made on the downpayment assistance

One of the areas that again is of most concern to me is housing 
for seniors and for persons with disabilities, and I do share in that 
goal of what the fund would try to do, and that is to help more

below. ",19
CHRG-110hhrg35406.htm," I am exerting all the moral influence I can to get this

    We approved their plan, and they had to implement the plan 
exactly as they said they would. That's probably the only 
leverage, if they don't do it, that we have over them. We can 
say, you're not doing what you agreed to do in your plan, but 
other than that, the first group of monies, it's--we have very

would come close to producing 1.5 million units of affordable housing. 


I want to conclude my testimony by saying that almost all housing 
programs are discretionary. Short of creating a new entitlement 
program, we are all left only with the difficult choices of allocating 
scarce funding for many worthy programs. I know that is not an 
easy task. 

As the committee looks for ways to address the issue of affordable 
housing, as you know, we could immediately address and help 
millions of people without any additional cost to the taxpayers

NHTF Hearing.txt," I think that is another good reason also to try 
to create economic diversity in the residential communities because 
that only helps strengthen the retail sectors in the surrounding 
area. And so the notion of creating these mixed-income communities 
that can then support retail areas, and at the same time 
break down the concentrations of poverty, is the way to go. 

One last comment on your last point. I think that the schools 
issue is another reason to try to get homeless or formerly homeless 
people into permanent housing right away. Ultimately, we would 
have an objective to eliminate the shelter system, to be able to get 
them into permanent homes so they are not moving around. And 
that again is often something that can be accomplished in the 
mixed income model. ",18

HR1892 hearing.txt," I will give you the very quick answer, we 
price for the risk and the mortgage insurance. Subprime lenders 
price for the risk and the interest rate. And, thus, you can see the

a month versus upwards of $300 more a month, and, yes, $137,000 
over the life of the loan. ",19
HR1892 hearing.txt," I will take blame for the 
security bond language in last year’s bill because I had it put in 
there. And I did it for a reason—mortgage brokers originate more 
loans than any other group in the marketplace out there. And yet 
if you look at the cost prohibitive, time consuming financial audits 
and net worth requirement, it limits brokers’ participation in the 
FHA program. And you wanted a minimum amount of flexibility, 
which I think is an understatement, I want to give you a maximum 
amount, but in some of these areas where we are talking about instead 
of as some might transfer assets, we all know how this is 
done, you can transfer assets and make your audit look really good, 
assets disappear, in the construction industry, we have been required 
for years to put up surety bonds and it has worked very, 
very well. And if it is a cash audit or it is a surety bond for the 
given amount of money, which equates to the same, one is accessible 
if there is a problem, I do not understand why we would limit 
participation in a program that I will state from my area when it 
has dropped 99 percent in 5 years, you and I both look and say 
there is a severe, severe problem here. And when you look at the 
largest group of loan originators in this country and we say how 
do we also provide flexibility for them as we are trying to provide 
for you and with that flexibility safeguard the requirements so we 
are not saying, okay, just do it without any safeguard. But somebody 
is going to write a surety bond, I know people who write surety 
bonds and they do not go out there and arbitrarily write a surety 
bond without knowing they have something to go after if that 
occurs. So why do you think that we cannot structure a reasonable

HR1892 hearing.txt," In 2006—is that better—1.2 million families entered 
into foreclosure, 42 percent more than in 2005. Predatory 
lending, exotic mortgages, and a dramatic rise in subprime lend-
ing,coupled with slowing home price appreciation have all contributed 
to this crisis. When the Federal Housing Administration was 
established back in 1934, consumers faced a similar lending crisis. 
At that time, FHA was an innovator and led the private market 
in offering safe, affordable home loans to American families. Since 
its inception, FHA has insured more than 34 million properties. 
However, the FHA has failed to keep pace with borrower needs and 
changes in the private market and is no longer a viable alternative 
for many borrowers. At the same time, the subprime and non-traditional 
mortgage markets have boomed. Many of these loans offer 
low teaser rates which reset to much higher rates after a few years. 
In many cases, these borrowers qualified only on their ability to 
make the initial payment and face large prepayment penalties if 
they attempt to refinance. Mortgage experts estimate that approximately 
$1.5 trillion worth of adjustable mortgages will reset by the 
end of 2007. Faced with significantly higher monthly payments, 
many borrowers will face the possibility of losing their homes. ",18

The greatness of a country will be measured by how it treats the 
least, the last, and the lost, not by how it treats the well-off, the 
well-heeled, and the well-to-do. The well-off, the well-heeled, and 
the well-to-do will always fare well. It is those who are in the 
streets of life that we have a duty to help. 

So I understand and I sympathize greatly with a lot of what has 
been said, but I also understand that right now we have 141,000 
homeless veterans, and there’s a proposal to cut $450 million from 
public housing. We have 170,000 homeless children and there’s a 
proposal to cut Section 8 vouchers by $500 million. We have 
754,000 homeless sheltered and unsheltered people, and there’s a 
proposal to cut CDBG by $736 million. We have 189,000 disabled 
homeless people, and there’s a proposal to cut Section 811, disabled 
housing, by $112 million. 

We are the richest country in the world. One out of every 110 
Americans is a millionaire. We spend $329 million not per year, not 
per month, not per week, but per day on the war. We can afford

    Secretary Jackson. Right.
    Ms. Waters. But it seems to me that if there is some way 
that you could use that information to determine that they have 
not followed their plan because they are not producing in a way 
that is very helpful, they're not expediting, please take a 
look at that.
    And two other things I don't know whether you can look at, 
but we--I discovered that they didn't know how to do 
appraisals, I don't think. They basically started out doing 
appraisals not based on the value of the house that was there 
prior to Katrina, but post-Katrina, after the houses had been 
turned over, blown over. So is there some way you could look at 
that?
    And also, clearing titles. They certainly don't know how to 
clear a title, and I know that there are some complications 
there because houses have been passed down not in a legal way. 
You know, through the years, the families have done this. But 
you can't hold up replacing those homes and getting homeowners 
back if they can't clear titles. So I wish that you and 
whatever experts you may have at your disposal would take a 
look at appraisals and clearing titles and see if you can find 
a way to use whatever leverage you might have to help them

bill allows any FHA-qualified borrower to participate in the new 
FHA low loan program. Second, the Frank-Waters bill authorizes 
the FHA to implement risk-based pricing but it leaves in place the 
current outdated premium caps of 2.25 percent up-front and 0.55 percent annually. And the zero and lower down payment loans  would have the higher caps. My concern is that these limits on premium caps will prevent FHA from serving riskier borrowers who  could be prudently served by charging a slightly higher premium.  With the flexibility to charge slightly higher premiums, FHA would  be able to serve borrowers with the lower FICO scores who are currently  being served only by the subprime market at very high interest  rates. With FHA mortgage insurance, lenders will charge 
borrowers the market mortgage interest rate. Without FHA insurance, 
they have no choice but to turn the borrower away or to 
charge for a risk in an increased mortgage interest rate. ",19

The holding of mortgage assets is somewhat of a zero sum game.

financial institutions and global financial institutions. 

The only difference is those financial institutions don’t have a 
charter, or a mission to serve the housing finance system, whereas 
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank system 
do. To arbitrarily limit the size of their portfolio based on the 
size of their affordable housing mission, or their affordable housing

Oxley, we know what the cost of these audits, they have skyrocketed.

HR1892 hearing.txt,"And speaking of fair price, 
when borrowers pay FHA insurance premiums, they are essentially 
buying a prime interest rate. An FHA-insured loan is generally 3 
to 4 percentages lower than a subprime loan. When comparing 
these two loan types on a $225,000 mortgage, this rate differences 
translates into an average savings of $300 a month. That is $137 
over the life of the loan. ",19
NHTF Hearing.txt,"And the language we’ve included in 
the bill allows that—but it says the excess funds, above solvency 
and those types of things that normally would go to the Treasury 
would go to this fund. But the appropriators use that excess and 
they credit it to our budget. ",18
HR1892 hearing.txt,"And we are trying to do what 
we can in this tight budget environment to help even more through 
the use of Low-Income Tax Credits, through home funds and others. 
But certainly I have said publicly, yes, there is a production 
problem relative to helping some of those groups, and we are trying 
to fix that. ",19
NHTF Hearing.txt,"And we’ve taken what we think is the middle course. We leave 
the benefits, although with greatly increased regulation, but we use 
some of that money for good public purpose. Similarly with the 
FHA, our bill, contrary to suggestions that it’s going to lead to FHA 
fee increases, in the bill that our committee passed we seek to prevent 
the Bush Administration from increasing FHA fees not because 
there is a need to do that to do FHA business but to help 
benefit the general Treasury. 

And section 30 of the bill would prohibit HUD from increasing 
any FHA premium above the level that was in effect at the beginning 
of this fiscal year unless the Secretary shows that in the absence 
of an increase the program would require a subsidy from the 
Congress. So we, in fact, strengthen the resistance to FHA fee increases, 
and that applies to what we’re doing here. 

If anything in this legislation that we have passed on the FHA 
that would get incorporated here were to cause a fee increase that 
would kick in. So we in fact prohibit fee increases. In fact our bill 
says no money goes to the housing fund if it were threatened, a fee 
increase. So the truth is that the bill that we passed already on the 
FHA, and it’s all part of one package conceptually, prevents a fee 
increase that is being contemplated. 


3 


And I will say, and I don’t ask for any comment on this, that my 
sense is that the desire for this fee increase did not come from the 
FHA and that it did not come from HUD, but it came from OMB. 
That is to be the FHA’s contribution to the war in Iraq. And we 
make it very clear that the FHA fee should increase only if there 
was a need to do that for FHA business. ",18
GSE hearing.txt,"and your observation that members of the

me. 

I totally agree with that concept, except that the peculiarity of 
these organizations, having an outside mission created by the Congress, 
I feel that there is less likelihood of an incestuous relationship 
existing if the outside appointees are made, in fact, by the normal 
members of the regulatory board. They have interests slightly 
different, in terms of mission, and whether or not, over a period of 
time, particularly the Federal Home Loan Bank system could be 
lost in its mission without any way of the Congress or anyone else 
correcting the mission, or bringing about or even finding out that 
the change of the mission has occurred. ",18
CHRG-108hhrg89410.htm,"Another question has come up with regard specifically to 
the HUD rule, and that is the feasibility and advisability and 
maybe constitutionality of the commingling of funds, and that 
is one the things that I want to address here.
    We are told that this program, as the President has 
announced it, assumes that people could get money and build a 
building that would be partly for religious purposes and partly 
for nonreligious purposes; and the amount that the building can 
be used in one way or the other would depend on the amount of 
money being put in.
    Now, one question I have is, is that physical or temporal? 
That is, since some religious institutions only have worship 1 
day a week, maybe 2 or 3 days a week, does that mean that you 
could take a building and build it, and if you prayed in it 1 
day a week, then you could use the whole building 6 days a week 
for other purposes? Or is it a physical separation?
    Another question is, how do we enforce some of these rules 
with regard to Community Development Block Grant entitlement 
communities? Frankly, some people have said that the Federal 
Government will be careful with the religious groups that it 
deals with, and that it won't deal with groups that might be 
problematic. But under the Community Development Block Grant I 
assume I understand correctly that an entitlement city under 
this rule could take the money and give it to any religious 
institution it wanted to. Does that mean that the Church of 
Scientology, the Nation of Islam and others would be eligible 
for the money and could then hire only its own members?
    Finally, I was pleased to see Secretary Martinez say at a 
recent hearing here, actually, on the down payment assistance 
program, that he did not think that we were abridging anybody's 
civil rights. Well, I have some questions about that. We have 
an Executive Order, 11246, that goes back to Franklin Roosevelt 
and A. Philip Randolph that has been interpreted by people as 
applying to the Community Development Block Grant program, and 
the Executive Order here says it no longer does.
    We also have this question: There is language in here that 
says the recipients will be independent from State and local 
governments. Does this purport to preempt or to say that State 
and local laws, we don't abide by them?
    And then we have this issue: Congress could, by statute, 
preempt State and local laws. But is the Administration 
contending that the Executive Order--that the President, by 
himself, can affect the binding nature of State and local laws?
    If we have State and local laws through which a grantee 
would ordinarily be subject, is it the position of the 
Administration that this Executive Order diminishes the force 
of those State and local laws? Because I think we run then into 
serious constitutional issues.",18

GSE hearing.txt,"Financing is much easier in urban areas; as you move out from 
the urban areas, it’s much more difficult. Even our government

me that since the populations have been moving out of cities into 
urban and suburban areas and rural areas, that we develop means 
and mechanism, both in the private sector and in government-sponsored 
enterprises, to have a uniform standard to meet these needs 
that are less shocking. 

I will give you an example—the rural development program, and 
business loans, and business guarantees. They are great on paper, 
except they really don’t apply in most areas—particularly Pennsylvania, 
because Pennsylvania is a State of very small communities—
but, they are bunched up alongside other communities

By virtue of the fact of their structure, they have been barred 
from giving government guarantees, even in communities of 2,000

NHTF Hearing.txt,"finding a safe and affordable home is becoming increasingly 
difficult for many Americans, and is proving to be especially 
hard for extremely-low-income Americans. Unfortunately, a 
disproportionate number of these people are African Americans and 
other racial and ethnic minorities. 

Currently only 46 percent of African Americans own their own 
homes, compared to more than 70 percent of white Americans. Perhaps 
more troubling than that statistic, however, is the disparate 
number of African Americans who spend too much of their income, 
which is already at the low end of the wage scale, on housing and 
utilities. 

The most current numbers we have indicate that 23 percent of 
African Americans fall into the extremely-low-income category. 
These men, women, children, and families have severe housing 
needs. In other words, they spend more than 50 percent of their income 
of housing and utilities. 


65 


In summary, half of all African Americans live in unaffordable, 
inadequate, and/or crowded housing. But of course, this is not only 
a problem for African Americans. Seventy-one percent of Hispanic 
Americans who fall into the extremely-low-income category have 
severe housing needs, and 66 percent of extremely-low-income Caucasians 
pay more than 50 percent of their income to ensure they 
have a roof over their heads. All these numbers add up to one 
alarming fact: Too many Americans of all races and ethnic backgrounds 
are too often forced to choose between shelter over their 
heads or food on their tables. 

If these numbers do not convince you of the clear need for a National 
Affordable Housing Trust Fund as established in this bill, let 
me also tell you that the situation is getting worse. In 2003, the 

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated 
that there was a deficit of two million extremely-low-income rental 
units. In 2005, that deficit had grown to four million. 
In 2003, HUD estimated that there were 44 affordable rental 
units available for every 100 extremely-low-income families. That 
number dropped to 40 units available in 2005, and the number continues 
to worsen. 

Unfortunately, the number of extremely-low-income households 
continues to grow as the number of affordable rental units decreases. 
As a matter of fact, of the 5.8 million black households reporting 
housing problems in 2003, 4.9 million cited housing afford-
ability as their biggest problem. ",18

HR1892 hearing.txt,"First, the Frank-Waters bill permits only first-time home buyers to 
participate in a new low and no down payment loan program. My 
bill allows any FHA-qualified borrower to participate in the new 
FHA low loan program. Second, the Frank-Waters bill authorizes 
the FHA to implement risk-based pricing but it leaves in place the 
current outdated premium caps of 2.25 percent up-front and 0.55 


4 


percent annually. And the zero and lower down payment loans 
would have the higher caps. My concern is that these limits on premium 
caps will prevent FHA from serving riskier borrowers who 
could be prudently served by charging a slightly higher premium. 
With the flexibility to charge slightly higher premiums, FHA would 
be able to serve borrowers with the lower FICO scores who are currently 
being served only by the subprime market at very high interest 
rates. With FHA mortgage insurance, lenders will charge 
borrowers the market mortgage interest rate. Without FHA insurance, 
they have no choice but to turn the borrower away or to 
charge for a risk in an increased mortgage interest rate. 

Just like last year’s House-passed bill, my bill implements premium 
caps, and enables the FHA to reach down and serve riskier 
borrowers, but in a prudent manner. The up-front premium is limited to a maximum of 3.0 percent, and the annual premium to a 
maximum of 2.0 percent.    
Third, my legislation includes another bipartisan agreement 
reached last year, the automatic reduction of annual premiums to 
no more than 55 basis points for loans that remain active after 5 
years. Automatic premium reductions can be a good thing. They 
can reduce refinancing and perhaps some defaults and foreclosures 
as well. In contrast, the Franks-Waters bill requires the refund of 
excess up-front premiums charged to higher risk borrowers, those 
with FICO scores below 560. I am concerned that this provision 
could have unintended consequences of limiting the number of borrowers 
that could be served by the FHA program because it may 
require initial premiums to be even higher. The refund provision 
would also be very difficult to implement. It is inevitable in an insurance 
fund that lower risk borrowers will subsidize higher risk 
borrowers. Refunds of this nature undercut the concept of insurance 
and is the logical equivalent of a healthy person requiring a 
100 percent refund of his or her health insurance premiums or a 
driver who does not get into an accident demanding his car insurance 
back. ",19
HR1892 hearing.txt,"First, we are proposing to eliminate our complicated down payment

Second, our proposal seeks to provide FHA the flexibility to set insurance 
premiums commensurate with the risk of the loans. In so 
doing, we could reach deeper into the pool of prospective borrowers 
while protecting the financial soundness of the FHA mortgage insurance 
fund. 

Lastly, I would like to mention the proposed increase in FHA 
loan limits. By increasing the loan limits to 65 percent and 100 
percent of the conforming loan limit, which we support, FHA would 
once again be a player in high cost areas, regions that have previously 
been out of play, such as the entire State of California and 
most of the Northeast. What is more, raising the floor to 65 percent 
of the conforming loan limit has the added benefit of giving families 
better access to newly constructed housing, which is on average 
more costly. ",19

Families legislation, would convert the Section 8 voucher 
program to a block grant, transferring its administration to 
the 50 States, and giving them discretion over allocation of 
funds, directly or indirectly.
    Section 8 supports over 4 million apartments. Roughly 1 in 
7 renters nationwide benefit from some form of Section 8 
assistance. Of the 4 million Section 8 households, about 35 
percent, or 1.4 million, have portable vouchers. The HANF 
proposal would fundamentally change the Federal funding system 
for tenant based housing assistance, from one based on actual 
cost to a block grant that simply distributes Federal 
appropriations among States.
    With the passage of HUD's funding year 2003 budget, block 
granting the program to States for this reason is unnecessary 
as the problem of under utilized vouchers has already been 
addressed. If funding levels fall behind the program's needs, 
as likely will occur, States will either have to contribute 
their own funds to the program or reduce assistance to low 
income families and elderly and disabled individuals.

United States PGA Golf Classic, which was won by Tiger Woods. 
Because of where it was, it attracted international attention

maintained; how well it looked; the attractiveness of it.

the world--mixed income, being successful. And then you get to 
the point of the single-headed households of females, who are 
single-family heads. A part of the major purpose of this 
program is to take that very targeted group and give them hope, 
to sustain them. The program is doing its duty and its good.
    Your other point--best use of the land. Not only is it the 
best use of the land, but the land surrounding that area has 
increased in Atlanta to a value of over $2 billion in the worth 
of the land surrounding it, and has proven to be the most

we did last year, to have the maximum flexibility. And that is one 
of the reasons for some of the predicament that we are in on the

percent, by the way, the difference between 3 percent—1 percent

that 51 percent of those are homeowner occupied. I myself can remember—

see that the paperwork involved in even trying to ‘‘prove’’ who lives

into foreclosure, 42 percent more than in 2005. Predatory 
lending, exotic mortgages, and a dramatic rise in subprime lend-
ing,coupled with slowing home price appreciation have all contributed 
to this crisis. When the Federal Housing Administration was 
established back in 1934, consumers faced a similar lending crisis. 
At that time, FHA was an innovator and led the private market 
in offering safe, affordable home loans to American families. Since 
its inception, FHA has insured more than 34 million properties. 
However, the FHA has failed to keep pace with borrower needs and 
changes in the private market and is no longer a viable alternative 
for many borrowers. At the same time, the subprime and non-traditional 
mortgage markets have boomed. Many of these loans offer 
low teaser rates which reset to much higher rates after a few years. 
In many cases, these borrowers qualified only on their ability to 
make the initial payment and face large prepayment penalties if 
they attempt to refinance. Mortgage experts estimate that approximately 
$1.5 trillion worth of adjustable mortgages will reset by the 
end of 2007. Faced with significantly higher monthly payments, 
many borrowers will face the possibility of losing their homes. ",18

to the FHA bill that passed the House last year. First, it eliminates 
the fee increases from last year’s bill for borrower who continue to 
make a down payment, scaling back the maximum up-front fee 
from 3 percent to 2.25 percent and the maximum annual fee from 

2.2 percent to .55 percent. These reductions will reduce FHA closing 
cost premiums for a hypothetical family buying a $300,000 
home by $2,250 in annual fees over a 5-year period of $20,000 compared 
to last year’s bill. 
The bill also adds a number of home buyer protections not included 
in last year’s bill for families taking out riskier zero-down 
payment loans and for borrowers who represent a higher credit 
risk. The bill gives HUD the authority to require pre-purchase 
counseling for riskier borrowers, requires a number of disclosures 
spelling out the costs and risk of zero down and lower down payment 
loans, and provides the borrower opt-in to receive notice of 
availability of counseling in the event a borrower falls behind in 
their loan payments. FHA has very strong loss mitigation measures 
in place so the borrower protections in the bill are a plus that 
are widely supported.

increased costs over time.

CHRG-108hhrg88663.htm,"NNCSHA also is grateful to Chairman Ney for introducing the 
Housing Assistance for Needy Families Act. NNCSHA neither 
supports nor opposes this legislation, but we believe it 
deserves Congress' full consideration. NNCSHA supports a 
voucher block grant in concept. However, we have taken a 
neutral stance on the administration's plan because of our 
serious concerns about the adequacy of the program funding and 
flexibility it proposes.
    Section 8 vouchers are one of our most important affordable 
housing tools, but the voucher program is not meeting its 
potential. Its complex rules and regulations block innovation, 
drive up costs, discourage private sector involvement, and 
confuse customers and administrators.
    The decentralization of funding to more than 2,500 PHAs 
complicates program administration, increases costs, prevents 
maximum utilization of funds and frustrates regional and 
statewide housing strategies. If implemented with sufficient 
funding and flexibility, HANF could resolve many of the current 
program's problems and create new opportunities for voucher 
use.
    States have the capacity to administer the voucher program. 
States possess a multi-decade record of responsibility, 
effectiveness, and accountability in administering tens of 
billions of dollars in housing assistance. They possess 
statewide sophisticated financial asset management and 
administrative oversight capability. Many States already 
administer Section 8.
    States are uniquely positioned to administer Federal 
housing resources. They understand local housing needs and 
markets, while bringing a State and regional perspective to 
problems that cannot be solved within municipal boundaries. 
States can ensure housing funding is applied where it is most 
needed and integrated with other public investments in their 
communities.
    Moreover, States have the ability to bring together State 
agencies and resources. State agencies are partners, for 
example, with welfare agencies to coordinate TANF funds with 
housing assistance. The voucher program, adequately funded and 
rationally regulated, would benefit from State administration.
    States' knowledge of local housing markets, access to other 
housing and nonhousing resources, ability to respond to 
changing local circumstances and prioritizing needs across 
States would overcome many of the voucher program's current 
limitations.
    Federal oversight would be more efficiently concentrated on 
50 entities. However, HANF must not be an underfunded mandate. 
We urge Congress to safeguard vouchers and the low income 
families who depend on them by authorizing mandatory voucher 
spending in an amount at least adequate to finance all 
currently authorized vouchers. Authorizing legislation must 
also specify that funds would be adjusted annually to cover 
cost increases.
    To work HANF must be a flexible program. It must be free 
from unnecessary and burdensome Federal requirements. HUD 
regulation must be limited to that necessary to assure 
nondiscrimination and accountability for the use of funds to 
achieve goals Congress sets. Performance standards must not 
compel States to respond to Federal priorities rather than 
their own.
    In conclusion, exploring ways to improve the Section 8 
voucher program is timely and appropriate. A block grant to the 
States merits Congress' examination and NNCSHA is available to 
assist you in that effort.",18

completion of a restatement of its financial records for 
earlier years. This announcement raised considerable concerns 
for those who monitor GSEs. It also began a period of intense 
scrutiny of the company by its regulators, lawmakers and the 
press.
    Six months later, Freddie Mac's Board announced an 
unexpected management shakeup. This change in corporate 
leadership produced even greater concerns among those with 
knowledge of GSEs. For example, I observed that government-
sponsored enterprises with public responsibilities and private 
capital have a special obligation to operate fairly, safely, 
and soundly. I believe and I continue to believe that today. 
The management of these entities must ensure that they produce 
accounting statements that reflect their real financial 
conditions.
    At the time I also said that Freddie Mac must maintain 
sufficient capital reserves, adopt prudent management reforms, 
expedite completion of its earnings restatements, and employ 
appropriate accounting techniques to prevent similar problems 
in the future. I suspect that, before we complete today's 
hearing, we will discuss each of these issues in great depth. 
We have a responsibility to study these matters and ensure that 
the company follows its statutory mandate to operate in a safe 
and sound manner.
    Additionally, the financial reporting problems by Freddie 
Mac renewed efforts by some to modify GSE regulation. As I said 
at our very first hearing on oversight of government-sponsored 
enterprises in March of 2000, we need to have strong 
independent regulators that have the resources they need to get 
the job done. I continue to support strong GSE regulation. A 
strong regulator will protect the continued validity of our 
capital markets and promote confidence in Freddie Mac and 
Fannie Mae. It will also ensure taxpayers against systemic risk 
and expand opportunities for all Americans.
    Today more than 68 percent of Americans own the homes in 
which they live. Government-sponsored enterprises have 
contributed greatly to this accomplishment. Because our housing

HR1892 hearing.txt,"Realtors support efforts to give consumers affordable alternatives 
to the more risky loans that are currently being heavily marketed. 
We believe the FHA could again be a viable, affordable alternative 
for borrowers with less than ideal credit. 

Today, we ask you to advance legislation that would reform the 
FHA Mortgage Insurance Program in several important ways. Increases 
in FHA loan limits are needed not just in high-cost areas, 
but nationwide. Such increases are critical for FHA to assist home 
buyers in places like California but also areas where home prices 
exceed the current maximum limit but are not defined as high cost, 
such as Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona. 

Second, we ask you to eliminate the statutory 3 percent minimum 
down payment on FHA-insured mortgages. In 2005, 43 percent 
of first-time home buyers financed 100 percent of their home. 
NAR research indicates that if FHA were allowed to offer this option, 
1.6 million families could benefit, including many low-income 
and minority home buyers. Eliminating the statutory 3 percent 
minimum cash investment will provide consumers a safe option 
away from non-traditional products. 

Third, NAR supports legislation that would provide FHA with 
the ability to charge borrowers different premiums based on risks 
of the borrowers and type of loan product. Currently, all FHA borrowers, 
regardless of risk, pay virtually the same premiums and receive 
the same interest rate. Giving FHA the flexibility to charge 
different borrowers different premiums based on risk will allow 
FHA to increase their pool of borrowers. Risk-based pricing makes 
sense in the private market and does for FHA as well. 

Fourth, NAR supports moving the Condo Program into the 203(b) 
Program and combining all single family programs into the Mutual 
Mortgage Insurance Fund. From a conceptual and accounting 
standpoint, it makes sound business sense to place all single family 
programs under the MMIF. We also recommend that HUD lift

problems closing the last financial gap, delaying the project for 18 
months, which only drove up the costs more and created a cyclical 
problem. 

It is precisely the type of development that could have been funded 
through this Act, particularly given its targeting. 

If there were more Federal funds available, it would have meant 
a quicker development process and ultimately more public benefit. 

Our St. John of God & St. Jean Baptiste developments, also in 
Massachusetts, are very similar. They could have used this trust 
fund enormously. 

Finally, the Saint Aidan, which is a 59 unit mixed-income development 
located in Brookline, Massachusetts—in Brookline, by the 
way, the median family house price for a single family home last 
year was $1 million. With prices like that, what happens is that 
the teachers, firefighters, and librarians have to enter town in the 
morning and leave town at night; the people who serve you can no 
longer afford to live in the communities with you. 

Saint Aidan’s, though, will be 60 percent affordable, and in this 
case we are fortunate enough to have had Chairman Frank as our 
Representative, with the benefit of his leadership to solve a number 
of problems with the project and for that, we, and the Archdiocese, 
are enormously grateful. 

The trust fund could have shortened a very long 7 years that it 
has taken us to get that development out of the ground, by giving 
us additional resources.

Some might think that since these got built, why do we need the 
trust fund? The process took far too long, was far too inefficient, 
and offered far less public benefit than could have occurred with 
the trust fund in place. 

Most importantly, these developments represent the 1.5 million 
homes that did not get built and would be if this Act were passed. ",18
NHTF Hearing.txt,"Rural housing need: America’s rural communities suffer from elevated 
poverty rates and substandard housing. Rural households on 
average are poorer, and according to the 2000 census, the poverty 
rate in rural America is 14 percent higher than the national rate. 

Likewise, Delaware’s rural counties have higher poverty rates 
than the State average, and experience similar conditions. For instance, 
57 percent of all workers statewide have insufficient income 
to afford a two-bedroom apartment in their county of employment. 

There is a deficit in this small State of 12,000 affordable housing 
units for those with extremely low incomes. A majority of Delaware’s 
20,000 substandard housing units in need of major repair or 
actual repayment exist in rural counties. And the median incomes 
in our rural counties are 30 percent lower than our metro county. 

In face of this need, rural housing spending for USDA programs 
has dropped 20 percent over the past 3 years. The Administration’s 
Fiscal Year 2008 budget request calls for elimination of most rural 
housing programs serving low-income households.

NCALL has been directly hit with the impact of such reductions, 
which have slowed rural housing really to a trickle. Increased affordability 
gaps at the same time have created more demand than 
ever. 

Availability of other Federal programs for rural areas: Even 
though a disproportionate amount of the Nation’s substandard 
housing is in rural areas, they are less likely to receive government-
assisted mortgages. For instance, 22 percent of the Nation’s 
population is in rural areas, but less than 7 percent of FHA assistance 
goes to non-metro areas. Only 10 percent of Veterans Affairs 
assistance reaches non-metro areas. Only 12 percent of Section 8 
funds go to non-metro areas. And in 2003, of the 9 million families 
assisted by Fannie Mae, only 11 percent lived in rural America. ",18

In addition, H.R. 1852 includes a number of important changes 
to the FHA bill that passed the House last year. First, it eliminates 
the fee increases from last year’s bill for borrower who continue to 
make a down payment, scaling back the maximum up-front fee 
from 3 percent to 2.25 percent and the maximum annual fee from 

2.2 percent to .55 percent. These reductions will reduce FHA closing 
cost premiums for a hypothetical family buying a $300,000 
home by $2,250 in annual fees over a 5-year period of $20,000 compared 
to last year’s bill. 
The bill also adds a number of home buyer protections not included 
in last year’s bill for families taking out riskier zero-down 
payment loans and for borrowers who represent a higher credit 
risk. The bill gives HUD the authority to require pre-purchase 
counseling for riskier borrowers, requires a number of disclosures 
spelling out the costs and risk of zero down and lower down payment 
loans, and provides the borrower opt-in to receive notice of 
availability of counseling in the event a borrower falls behind in 
their loan payments. FHA has very strong loss mitigation measures 
in place so the borrower protections in the bill are a plus that 
are widely supported. ",18

HANF reduce the number of families currently receiving

eliminate the flexibility of vouchers? Today, I am interested 
in hearing about two more of these known unknowns. First, will 
block granting dampen landlord participation in the program? 
Currently, HANF includes no assurance of continued funding of 
existing vouchers from year to year. It also gives States the 
authority to cut the subsidy level of vouchers and place 
lifetime limits on benefits, leaving Section 8 families with 
nowhere to live. Wouldn't this force landlords to undergo 
lengthy and expensive legal eviction processes for each of 
their tenants, and thereby discourage their participation in

do to improve voucher utilization, some of which were in H.R. 
3995, your omnibus housing bill from the last Congress, and in 
bills in the Senate. First, HUD has the option to reallocate 
unused vouchers from one administering agency to another, and 
Congress should require reallocation from communities that 
cannot use all their housing vouchers to those who can, and to 
the extent possible keep those housing vouchers in the same 
region. The threshold for reallocation should be quite high, a 
95 percent utilization rate.
    Second, Congress should enact reforms that will incentivize 
owners of rental property to participate in the program, in 
particular making the inspection process more flexible and less 
time consuming for owners, a proposal that was detailed in H.R. 
3995. And third, Congress should establish a housing success 
fund or other mechanism to help housing voucher holders find 
and access available housing with funds for application fees, 
credit checks, security deposits and the like, as well as 
supporting housing search assistance, outreach and counseling 
and those kinds of things.
    We know that some landlords decline to accept housing 
vouchers because they object to the people who are voucher 
holders. Congress should consider a testing program that would 
attempt to discern the extent to which discrimination against 
voucher holders violates Federal fair housing laws. Ultimately, 
the success of the housing voucher program does depend on the

GSE hearing.txt,"There seems to be general agreement 
on the fundamental tools that the new regulator will need. MBA 
is particularly interested in the powers of the regulator related to 
the review and approval of GSE activities, ongoing and new. 

Today, it is unclear whether certain current GSE activities are 
actually permitted. The new regulator needs sufficient authority to 
solve this problem. MBA has reviewed the recently introduced bill, 

H.R. 1427. We believe that the product approval language heads in 
the right direction to satisfy some of these concerns, and we strongly 
oppose any effort to weaken it. 
We particularly support the no limitation clause at the end of 
this section on powers to review new and existing products or activities. 
This is essential authority for a world class financial regulator. 


We appreciate that H.R. 1427 calculates the size of the contribution 
to the affordable housing fund on the GSEs’ portfolio, rather 
than on net income. This approach would make it more difficult for 
the GSEs to pass the cost of their contribution on to mortgage lenders 
and consumers. It would also tie a benefit of government sponsorship, 
the lower capital cost, to the GSEs’ affordable housing contributions. 


Various proposals have been offered to regulate the GSEs’ investment 
portfolios, and we are pleased with the progress H.R. 1427 
makes in this area. MBA maintains that the GSEs’ portfolios are 
an important part of their ability to help stabilize mortgage markets, 
and encourage affordable housing. 


10 


Because markets are dynamic, the GSEs need flexibility to adjust 
their portfolios to changing conditions and marketplace needs. 
MBA does not believe there is a need to expand the definition of 
high-cost areas under the GSE charters, and we respectfully ask 
the committee to consider the points in our written testimony. 

Jumbo loan borrowers are well served by the private sector, and 
there is no lack of liquidity in the primary or secondary market for 
these borrowers. We note that H.R. 1427 requires the registration 
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock, but not mortgage-backed securities, 
and we are supporters of that approach. 

Finally, Congress should strengthen both the secondary mortgage 
market and the Federal Home Loan Banks, by expressly affirming 
in H.R. 1427, that the Banks are authorized to securitize 
loans",18
CHRG-108hhrg88663.htm,"there will probably be some PHAs

Chairman, that CFI expansion would benefit all. 

Since Congress has now debated significant regulatory reforms to 
the regulatory oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal 
Home Loan Banks, it’s a good time to look at the oversight of 
another GSE, the farm credit system. This issue is especially important 
in a year such as this, when Congress is considering renewal 
of the Farm Bill. 

We expect the farm credit system to attempt to expand into nonfarm

can reduce refinancing and perhaps some defaults and foreclosures 
as well. In contrast, the Franks-Waters bill requires the refund of 
excess up-front premiums charged to higher risk borrowers, those 
with FICO scores below 560. I am concerned that this provision 
could have unintended consequences of limiting the number of borrowers 
that could be served by the FHA program because it may 
require initial premiums to be even higher. The refund provision 
would also be very difficult to implement. It is inevitable in an insurance 
fund that lower risk borrowers will subsidize higher risk 
borrowers. Refunds of this nature undercut the concept of insurance 
and is the logical equivalent of a healthy person requiring a 
100 percent refund of his or her health insurance premiums or a 
driver who does not get into an accident demanding his car insurance 
back. ",19

NHTF Hearing.txt,"To bring the full force of scarce housing trust funds and all funds 
to bear on these urgent housing programs, we do offer four general 
suggestions for the committee’s consideration: 

First, we suggest you allocate housing trust funds through the 
States as they can most effectively and efficiently leverage them 
with the housing credit and other production resources they administer 
in amounts sufficient to make a difference, and direct these 
resources to the greatest relative needs within their jurisdictions. 

Second, we suggest that you eliminate overly complex and unnecessary 
rules that will limit State flexibility, will be barriers to the 
combination of other trust funds with other housing resources, and 
add time and therefore cost to the development and compliance 
process. 

Third, we suggest to the committee that you make the match requirement 
sufficiently flexible that it does not deny jurisdictions 
funding they want and need by, for example, limiting it to 25 percent, 
as the HOME program requires, and giving States equal credit 
for investment of Federal and non-Federal resources in trust 
properties and programs. 

And finally, and very importantly, Mr. Chairman we suggest this 
committee and Congress create a source of long-term operating 
support for rental properties housing extremely-low-income families. 
This is the largest barrier to their development, and short-
term operating subsidies such as those permitted under the trust 
legislation will not overcome this barrier. ",18

HR1892 hearing.txt,"Today, we ask you to advance legislation that would reform the 
FHA Mortgage Insurance Program in several important ways. Increases 
in FHA loan limits are needed not just in high-cost areas, 
but nationwide. Such increases are critical for FHA to assist home 
buyers in places like California but also areas where home prices 
exceed the current maximum limit but are not defined as high cost, 
such as Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona. 

Second, we ask you to eliminate the statutory 3 percent minimum 
down payment on FHA-insured mortgages. In 2005, 43 percent 
of first-time home buyers financed 100 percent of their home. 
NAR research indicates that if FHA were allowed to offer this option, 
1.6 million families could benefit, including many low-income 
and minority home buyers. Eliminating the statutory 3 percent 
minimum cash investment will provide consumers a safe option 
away from non-traditional products. 

Third, NAR supports legislation that would provide FHA with 
the ability to charge borrowers different premiums based on risks 
of the borrowers and type of loan product. Currently, all FHA borrowers, 
regardless of risk, pay virtually the same premiums and receive 
the same interest rate. Giving FHA the flexibility to charge 
different borrowers different premiums based on risk will allow 
FHA to increase their pool of borrowers. Risk-based pricing makes 
sense in the private market and does for FHA as well. 

Fourth, NAR supports moving the Condo Program into the 203(b) 
Program and combining all single family programs into the Mutual 
Mortgage Insurance Fund. From a conceptual and accounting 
standpoint, it makes sound business sense to place all single family 
programs under the MMIF. We also recommend that HUD lift 
many of the barriers that make condominium purchase difficult 
under FHA. We believe the current policies limit sales and home

funding cuts over time, and that is unacceptable.
    In addition, it does not give States the flexibility they 
would truly need to achieve the efficiencies that the

we would need to see guaranteed funding, mandatory spending,

for example. States would need to know from year to year that 
they were going to get sufficient funds, not only to provide 
for the families who currently receive them, but to cover 
increased costs over time. And, frankly, we would like to see 
new voucher program money in this program. No new vouchers have

you are at about $26. And at 3 percent, you are at roughly $39.95 
or so. So the difference is not much. Now the $225,000 figure in 
this room sounds like a low amount. But as Congressman 
Neugebauer from Texas knows, that is a big home in the South and 
in the Midwest and in other parts of the country. As a matter of 
fact, 75 percent of our mortgages currently are below $150,000. 
And the average cost on average, the median for FHA, is somewhere 
around a $130,000 mortgage. So the $225,000 example is 
half that for the lower income—or the lower priced home.",19
HR1892 hearing.txt,"Well, like we did last year, and we are doing 
this year, in some cases we are preparing for a victory party let’s 
say that we may not have. I say that in that we cannot wait. Hopefully, 
we will get a reformed FHA bill through. We cannot wait 
until that moment in time to say, ‘‘What do we do now?’’ So we 
were meeting last year, and we have been meeting this year with 
our IT staff. We are prepared to make the changes to our underwriting 
system to what is called our total scorecard. And to begin, 
we also have been putting together what the training for lenders 
would look like. We would be ready on day one. We would be more 
ready on day two, but we will be ready on day one. ",19
HR1892 hearing.txt,"Well, right now we are serving roughly 
500,000 borrowers. As you know, our volume of business has been 
in a free fall for about 3 or 4 years. The good news is that, through 
some process improvements, we have sort of stopped the hemorrhaging, 
but we think again in Mr. Miller’s State and others, the 
fact that they cannot use this product did not make any sense to 
us. That is why we want to improve it. ",19
HR1892 hearing.txt,"Well, specifically, one idea that I have, or one 
hurdle that is out there I have read about, is that some homeowners 
who would otherwise make good candidates with an FHA 
loan with a decent track record on time payments may be barred 
from refinancing with FHA if they are not current on their existing 
loan. Oftentimes, because they are suffering from the payment 
shock of the interest rate reset, jumping from the teaser rates to 
a higher level, do you think looking into changing this requirement 
might benefit homeowners and FHA if it could be done in a way 
that is responsible? ",18
HR1892 hearing.txt,"Well, that is critical. We are an insurance 
company; we are in the risk business. We are in the business of 
helping lower income borrowers with little savings for a down payment 
and perhaps some blemishes on their credit. That is what we 
have done for decades now. But we take very seriously protecting 
the solvency in the FHA fund so we put each risk category through 
a rigorous test, through an actuarial review. Our Office of Evaluation 
conducts that. And it is critically important for us to be able 
to identify any number of different variables for all borrowers. By 
the way, that pool of borrowers that we have profiles that we can 
look at is some 4.5 million or so different risk profiles.",19
HR1892 hearing.txt,"Well, that is why I have been fighting 
for optional Federal charters for the insurance industry because 
every State requires a different base, some allow third party insurers, 
some do not, so I do not disagree there, but if the bond is written 
in a fashion acceptable, I do not know why that would be precluded 
from the conversation? ",18
NHTF Hearing.txt,"Well, the IRS had no problem with 
them prior to you guys changing the ruling, but once you changed 
the ruling that they were not a charity, per se, then they were in 
violation of the law and the IRS. But the point is that if you have 
$5,000 or $3,000 given to an individual from the government for 
downpayment assistance or you have $5,000 from the private sector 
given to an individual for downpayment assistance, what’s the 
difference? ",18
NHTF Hearing.txt,"Well, the proposal last year, as you know, was 
32 basis points. This year it is half of that. It would only be 16 
basis points. But sir, I just want to make sure as last year there 
will be plenty of time for public comment. ",19
HR1892 hearing.txt,"Well, the realities have estimated last year 
about 45 percent of loans were made with no down payment. Our 
proposal does away with the requirement for a 3 percent cash investment 
but essentially runs the gamut in between from a 97 percent 
LTV up to 99.95 LTV, if you will. Because of the risk-based 
approach and families having some choice, how much they want in 
an up-front premium or in an annual premium, they can in many 
cases have that choice. It is just like families have today, some 
families elect to pay a little higher interest rate to keep more 
money in their pocket so they can pay for a new refrigerator or upgrades 
to their home and the like. ",19

a very vigorous loss mitigation program, we require lenders to 
reach out and to work with borrowers who are in trouble and, yes, 
we saved 75,000 families last year—FHA-insured families from 
foreclosure. I think that point is more important today than probably 
at any point in the last several years, especially as we see
